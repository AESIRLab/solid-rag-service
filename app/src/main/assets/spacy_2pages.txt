Charles Robert Darwin ( DAR-win; 12 February 1809 – 19 April 1882) was an English naturalist, geologist, and biologist, widely known for his contributions to evolutionary biology.<ch_s>His proposition that all species of life have descended from a common ancestor is now generally accepted and considered a fundamental scientific concept.<ch_s>In a joint presentation with Alfred Russel Wallace, he introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process he called natural selection, in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding.<ch_s>Darwin has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history and was honoured by burial in Westminster Abbey.
<ch_s>Darwin's early interest in nature led him to neglect his medical education at the University of Edinburgh; instead, he helped to investigate marine invertebrates.<ch_s>His studies at the University of Cambridge's Christ's College from 1828 to 1831 encouraged his passion for natural science.<ch_s>However, it was his five-year voyage on HMS Beagle from 1831 to 1836 that truly established Darwin as an eminent geologist.<ch_s>The observations and theories he developed during his voyage supported Charles Lyell's concept of gradual geological change.<ch_s>Publication of his journal of the voyage made Darwin famous as a popular author.
<ch_s>Puzzled by the geographical distribution of wildlife and fossils he collected on the voyage, Darwin began detailed investigations and, in 1838, devised his theory of natural selection.<ch_s>Although he discussed his ideas with several naturalists, he needed time for extensive research, and his geological work had priority.<ch_s>He was writing up his theory in 1858 when Alfred Russel Wallace sent him an essay that described the same idea, prompting the immediate joint submission of both their theories to the Linnean Society of London.<ch_s>Darwin's work established evolutionary descent with modification as the dominant scientific explanation of natural diversification.<ch_s>In 1871, he examined human evolution and sexual selection in The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, followed by The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872).<ch_s>His research on plants was published in a series of books, and in his final book, The Formation of Vegetable Mould, through the Actions of Worms (1881), he examined earthworms and their effect on soil.
<ch_s>Darwin published his theory of evolution with compelling evidence in his 1859 book On the Origin of Species.<ch_s>By the 1870s, the scientific community and a majority of the educated public had accepted evolution as a fact.<ch_s>However, many initially favoured  competing explanations that gave only a minor role to natural selection, and it was not until the emergence of the modern evolutionary synthesis from the 1930s to the 1950s that a broad consensus developed in which natural selection was the basic mechanism of evolution.<ch_s>Darwin's scientific discovery is the unifying theory of the life sciences, explaining the diversity of life.


<ch_s>== Biography ==


=== Early life and education ===

Darwin was born in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, on 12 February 1809, at his family's home, The Mount.<ch_s>He was the fifth of six children of wealthy society doctor and financier Robert Darwin and Susannah Darwin (née Wedgwood).<ch_s>His grandfathers Erasmus Darwin and Josiah Wedgwood were both prominent abolitionists.<ch_s>Erasmus Darwin had praised general concepts of evolution and common descent in his Zoonomia (1794), a poetic fantasy of gradual creation including undeveloped ideas anticipating concepts his grandson expanded.

<ch_s>Both families were largely Unitarian, though the Wedgwoods were adopting Anglicanism.<ch_s>Robert Darwin, a freethinker, had baby Charles baptised in November 1809 in the Anglican St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury, but Charles and his siblings attended the local Unitarian Church with their mother.<ch_s>The eight-year-old Charles already had a taste for natural history and collecting when he joined the day school run by its preacher in 1817.<ch_s>That July, his mother died.<ch_s>From September 1818, he joined his older brother Erasmus in attending the nearby Anglican Shrewsbury School as a boarder.
<ch_s>Darwin spent the summer of 1825 as an apprentice doctor, helping his father treat the poor of Shropshire, before going to the well-regarded University of Edinburgh Medical School with his brother Erasmus in October 1825.<ch_s>Darwin found lectures dull and surgery distressing, so he neglected his studies.<ch_s>He learned taxidermy in around 40 daily hour-long sessions from John Edmonstone, a freed black slave who had accompanied Charles Waterton in the South American rainforest.
<ch_s>In Darwin's second year at the university, he joined the Plinian Society, a student natural-history group featuring lively debates in which radical democratic students with materialistic views challenged orthodox religious concepts of science.<ch_s>He assisted Robert Edmond Grant's investigations of the anatomy and life cycle of marine invertebrates in the Firth of Forth, and on 27 March 1827 presented at the Plinian his own discovery that black spores found in oyster shells were the eggs of a skate leech.<ch_s>One day, Grant praised Lamarck's evolutionary ideas.<ch_s>Darwin was astonished by Grant's audacity, but had recently read similar ideas in his grandfather Erasmus' journals.<ch_s>Darwin was rather bored by Robert Jameson's natural-history course, which covered geology – including the debate between neptunism and plutonism.<ch_s>He learned the classification of plants and assisted with work on the collections of the University Museum, one of the largest museums in Europe at the time.
<ch_s>Darwin's neglect of medical studies annoyed his father, who sent him to Christ's College, Cambridge, in January 1828, to study for a Bachelor of Arts degree as the first step towards becoming an Anglican country parson.<ch_s>Darwin was unqualified for Cambridge's Tripos exams and was required instead to join the ordinary degree course.<ch_s>He preferred riding and shooting to studying.

<ch_s>During the first few months of Darwin's enrolment at Christ's College, his second cousin William Darwin Fox was still studying there.<ch_s>Fox impressed him with his butterfly collection, introducing Darwin to entomology and influencing him to pursue beetle collecting.<ch_s>He did this zealously and had some of his finds published in James Francis Stephens' Illustrations of British entomology (1829–1932).
<ch_s>Through Fox, Darwin became a close friend and follower of botany professor John Stevens Henslow.<ch_s>He met other leading parson-naturalists who saw scientific work as religious natural theology, becoming known to these dons as "the man who walks with Henslow".<ch_s>When his own exams drew near, Darwin applied himself to his studies and was delighted by the language and logic of William Paley's Evidences of Christianity (1795).<ch_s>In his final examination in January 1831, Darwin did well, coming tenth out of 178 candidates for the ordinary degree.
<ch_s>Darwin had to stay at Cambridge until June 1831.<ch_s>He studied Paley's Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity (first published in 1802), which made an argument for divine design in nature, explaining adaptation as God acting through laws of nature.<ch_s>He read John Herschel's new book, Preliminary Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy (1831), which described the highest aim of natural philosophy as understanding such laws through inductive reasoning based on observation, and Alexander von Humboldt's Personal Narrative of scientific travels in 1799–1804.<ch_s>Inspired with "a burning zeal" to contribute, Darwin planned to visit Tenerife with some classmates after graduation to study natural history in the tropics.<ch_s>In preparation, he joined Adam Sedgwick's geology course, then on 4 August travelled with him to spend a fortnight mapping strata in Wales.


<ch_s>=== Survey voyage on HMS Beagle ===

After leaving Sedgwick in Wales, Darwin spent a few days with student friends at Barmouth.<ch_s>He returned home on 29 August to find a letter from Henslow proposing him as a suitable (if unfinished) naturalist for a self-funded supernumerary place on HMS Beagle with captain Robert FitzRoy, a position for a gentleman rather than "a mere collector".<ch_s>The ship was to leave in four weeks on an expedition to chart the coastline of South America.<ch_s>Robert Darwin objected to his son's planned two-year voyage, regarding it as a waste of time, but was persuaded by his brother-in-law, Josiah Wedgwood II, to agree to (and fund) his son's participation.<ch_s>Darwin took care to remain in a private capacity to retain control over his collection, intending it for a major scientific institution.
<ch_s>After delays, the voyage began on 27 December 1831; it lasted almost five years.<ch_s>As FitzRoy had intended, Darwin spent most of that time on land investigating geology and making natural history collections, while HMS Beagle surveyed and charted coasts.<ch_s>He kept careful notes of his observations and theoretical speculations.<ch_s>At intervals during the voyage, his specimens were sent to Cambridge together with letters including a copy of his journal for his family.<ch_s>He had some expertise in geology, beetle collecting and dissecting marine invertebrates, but in all other areas, was a novice and ably collected specimens for expert appraisal.<ch_s>Despite suffering badly from seasickness, Darwin wrote copious notes while on board the ship.<ch_s>Most of his zoology notes are about marine invertebrates, starting with plankton collected during a calm spell.

<ch_s>On their first stop ashore at St Jago in Cape Verde, Darwin found that a white band high in the volcanic rock cliffs included seashells.<ch_s>FitzRoy had given him the first volume of Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology, which set out uniformitarian concepts of land slowly rising or falling over immense periods,[II] and Darwin saw things Lyell's way, theorising and thinking of writing a book on geology.<ch_s>When they reached Brazil, Darwin was delighted by the tropical forest, but detested the sight of slavery there, and disputed this issue with FitzRoy.
<ch_s>The survey continued to the south in Patagonia.<ch_s>They stopped at Bahía Blanca, and in cliffs near Punta Alta Darwin made a major find of fossil bones of huge extinct mammals beside modern seashells, indicating recent extinction with no signs of change in climate or catastrophe.<ch_s>He found bony plates like a giant version of the armour on local armadillos.<ch_s>From a jaw and tooth he identified the gigantic Megatherium, then from Cuvier's description thought the armour was from this animal.<ch_s>The finds were shipped to England, and scientists found the fossils of great interest.<ch_s>In Patagonia, Darwin came to wrongly believe the territory was devoid of reptiles.
<ch_s>On rides with gauchos into the interior to explore geology and collect more fossils, Darwin gained social, political and anthropological insights into both native and colonial people at a time of revolution, and learnt that two types of rhea had separate but overlapping territories.<ch_s>Further south, he saw stepped plains of shingle and seashells as raised beaches at a series of elevations.<ch_s>He read Lyell's second volume and accepted its view of "centres of creation" of species, but his discoveries and theorising challenged Lyell's ideas of smooth continuity and of extinction of species.
<ch_s>Three Fuegians on board, who had been seized during the first Beagle voyage then given Christian education in England, were returning with a missionary.<ch_s>Darwin found them friendly and civilised, yet at Tierra del Fuego he met "miserable, degraded savages", as different as wild from domesticated animals.<ch_s>He remained convinced that, despite this diversity, all humans were interrelated with a shared origin and potential for improvement towards civilisation.<ch_s>Unlike his scientist friends, he now thought there was no unbridgeable gap between humans and animals.<ch_s>A year on, the mission had been abandoned.<ch_s>The Fuegian they had named Jemmy Button lived like the other natives, had a wife, and had no wish to return to England.

<ch_s>Darwin experienced an earthquake in Chile in 1835 and saw signs that the land had just been raised, including mussel-beds stranded above high tide.<ch_s>High in the Andes he saw seashells and several fossil trees that had grown on a sand beach.<ch_s>He theorised that as the land rose, oceanic islands sank, and coral reefs round them grew to form atolls.
<ch_s>On the geologically new Galápagos Islands, Darwin looked for evidence attaching wildlife to an older "centre of creation", and found mockingbirds allied to those in Chile but differing from island to island.<ch_s>He heard that slight variations in the shape of tortoise shells showed which island they came from, but failed to collect them, even after eating tortoises taken on board as food.<ch_s>In Australia, the marsupial rat-kangaroo and the platypus seemed so unusual that Darwin thought it was almost as though two distinct Creators had been at work.<ch_s>He found the Aborigines "good-humoured & pleasant", their numbers depleted by European settlement.
<ch_s>FitzRoy investigated how the atolls of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands had formed, and the survey supported Darwin's theorising.<ch_s>FitzRoy began writing the official Narrative of the Beagle voyages, and after reading Darwin's diary, he proposed incorporating it into the account.<ch_s>Darwin's Journal was eventually rewritten as a separate third volume, on geology and natural history.
<ch_s>In Cape Town, South Africa, Darwin and FitzRoy met John Herschel, who had recently written to Lyell praising his uniformitarianism as opening bold speculation on "that mystery of mysteries, the replacement of extinct species by others" as "a natural in contradistinction to a miraculous process".
<ch_s>When organising his notes as the ship sailed home, Darwin wrote that, if his growing suspicions about the mockingbirds, the tortoises and the Falkland Islands fox were correct, "such facts undermine the stability of Species", then cautiously added "would" before "undermine".<ch_s>He later wrote that such facts "seemed to me to throw some light on the origin of species".
<ch_s>Without telling Darwin, extracts from his letters to Henslow had been read to scientific societies, printed as a pamphlet for private distribution among members of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, and reported in magazines, including The Athenaeum.<ch_s>Darwin first heard of this at Cape Town, and at Ascension Island read of Sedgwick's prediction that Darwin "will have a great name among the Naturalists of Europe".


<ch_s>=== Inception of Darwin's evolutionary theory ===

On 2 October 1836, Beagle anchored at Falmouth, Cornwall.<ch_s>Darwin promptly made the long coach journey to Shrewsbury to visit his home and see relatives.<ch_s>He then hurried to Cambridge to see Henslow, who advised him on finding available naturalists to catalogue Darwin's animal collections and to take on the botanical specimens.<ch_s>Darwin's father organised investments, enabling his son to be a self-funded gentleman scientist, and an excited Darwin went around the London institutions being fêted and seeking experts to describe the collections.<ch_s>British zoologists at the time had a huge backlog of work, due to natural history collecting being encouraged throughout the British Empire, and there was a danger of specimens just being left in storage.
<ch_s>Charles Lyell eagerly met Darwin for the first time on 29 October and soon introduced him to the up-and-coming anatomist Richard Owen, who had the facilities of the Royal College of Surgeons to work on the fossil bones collected by Darwin.<ch_s>Owen's surprising results included other gigantic extinct ground sloths as well as the Megatherium Darwin had identified, a near complete skeleton of the unknown Scelidotherium and a hippopotamus-sized rodent-like skull named Toxodon resembling a giant capybara.<ch_s>The armour fragments were actually from Glyptodon, a huge armadillo-like creature, as Darwin had initially thought.<ch_s>These extinct creatures were related to living species in South America.
<ch_s>In mid-December, Darwin took lodgings in Cambridge to arrange expert classification of his collections, and prepare his own research for publication.<ch_s>Questions of how to combine his diary into the Narrative were resolved at the end of the month when FitzRoy accepted Broderip's advice to make it a separate volume, and Darwin began work on his Journal and Remarks.
<ch_s>Darwin's first paper showed that the South American landmass was slowly rising.<ch_s>With Lyell's enthusiastic backing, he read it to the Geological Society of London on 4 January 1837.<ch_s>On the same day, he presented his mammal and bird specimens to the Zoological Society.<ch_s>The ornithologist John Gould soon announced that the Galápagos birds that Darwin had thought a mixture of blackbirds, "gros-beaks" and finches, were, in fact, twelve separate species of finches.<ch_s>On 17 February, Darwin was elected to the Council of the Geological Society, and Lyell's presidential address presented Owen's findings on Darwin's fossils, stressing geographical continuity of species as supporting his uniformitarian ideas.

<ch_s>Early in March, Darwin moved to London to be near this work, joining Lyell's social circle of scientists and experts such as Charles Babbage, who described God as a programmer of laws.<ch_s>Darwin stayed with his freethinking brother Erasmus, part of this Whig circle and a close friend of the writer Harriet Martineau, who promoted the Malthusianism that underpinned the controversial Whig Poor Law reforms to stop welfare from causing overpopulation and more poverty.<ch_s>As a Unitarian, she welcomed the radical implications of transmutation of species, promoted by Grant and younger surgeons influenced by Geoffroy.<ch_s>Transmutation was anathema to Anglicans defending social order, but reputable scientists openly discussed the subject, and there was wide interest in John Herschel's letter praising Lyell's approach as a way to find a natural cause of the origin of new species.
<ch_s>Gould met Darwin and told him that the Galápagos mockingbirds from different islands were separate species, not just varieties, and what Darwin had thought was a "wren" was in the finch group.<ch_s>Darwin had not labelled the finches by island, but from the notes of others on the ship, including FitzRoy, he allocated species to islands.<ch_s>The two rheas were distinct species, and on 14 March Darwin announced how their distribution changed going southwards.
<ch_s>By mid-March 1837, barely six months after his return to England, Darwin was speculating in his Red Notebook on the possibility that "one species does change into another" to explain the geographical distribution of living species such as the rheas, and extinct ones such as the strange extinct mammal Macrauchenia, which resembled a giant guanaco, a llama relative.<ch_s>Around mid-July, he recorded in his "B" notebook his thoughts on lifespan and variation across generations – explaining the variations he had observed in Galápagos tortoises, mockingbirds, and rheas.<ch_s>He sketched branching descent, and then a genealogical branching of a single evolutionary tree, in which "It is absurd to talk of one animal being higher than another", thereby discarding Lamarck's idea of independent lineages progressing to higher forms.


<ch_s>=== Overwork, illness, and marriage ===

While developing this intensive study of transmutation, Darwin became mired in more work.<ch_s>Still rewriting his Journal, he took on editing and publishing the expert reports on his collections, and with Henslow's help obtained a Treasury grant of £1,000 to sponsor this multi-volume Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle, a sum equivalent to about £115,000 in 2021.<ch_s>He stretched the funding to include his planned books on geology, and agreed to unrealistic dates with the publisher.<ch_s>As the Victorian era began, Darwin pressed on with writing his Journal, and in August 1837 began correcting printer's proofs.
<ch_s>As Darwin worked under pressure, his health suffered.<ch_s>On 20 September, he had "an uncomfortable palpitation of the heart", so his doctors urged him to "knock off all work" and live in the country for a few weeks.<ch_s>After visiting Shrewsbury, he joined his Wedgwood relatives at Maer Hall, Staffordshire, but found them too eager for tales of his travels to give him much rest.<ch_s>His charming, intelligent, and cultured cousin Emma Wedgwood, nine months older than Darwin, was nursing his invalid aunt.<ch_s>His uncle Josiah pointed out an area of ground where cinders had disappeared under loam and suggested that this might have been the work of earthworms, inspiring "a new & important theory" on their role in soil formation, which Darwin presented at the Geological Society on 1 November 1837.<ch_s>His Journal was printed and ready for publication by the end of February 1838, as was the first volume of the Narrative, but FitzRoy was still working hard to finish his own volume.
<ch_s>William Whewell pushed Darwin to take on the duties of Secretary of the Geological Society.<ch_s>After initially declining the work, he accepted the post in March 1838.<ch_s>Despite the grind of writing and editing the Beagle reports, Darwin made remarkable progress on transmutation, taking every opportunity to question expert naturalists and, unconventionally, people with practical experience in selective breeding such as farmers and pigeon fanciers.<ch_s>Over time, his research drew on information from his relatives and children, the family butler, neighbours, colonists and former shipmates.<ch_s>He included mankind in his speculations from the outset, and on seeing an orangutan in the zoo on 28 March 1838 noted its childlike behaviour.
<ch_s>The strain took a toll, and by June he was being laid up for days on end with stomach problems, headaches and heart symptoms.<ch_s>For the rest of his life, he was repeatedly incapacitated with episodes of stomach pains, vomiting, severe boils, palpitations, trembling and other symptoms, particularly during times of stress, such as attending meetings or making social visits.<ch_s>The cause of Darwin's illness remained unknown, and attempts at treatment had only ephemeral success.
<ch_s>On 23 June, he took a break and went "geologising" in Scotland.<ch_s>He visited Glen Roy in glorious weather to see the parallel "roads" cut into the hillsides at three heights.<ch_s>He later published his view that these were marine-raised beaches, but then had to accept that they were shorelines of a proglacial lake.

<ch_s>Fully recuperated, he returned to Shrewsbury in July 1838.<ch_s>Used to jotting down daily notes on animal breeding, he scrawled rambling thoughts about marriage, career and prospects on two scraps of paper, one with columns headed "Marry" and "Not Marry".<ch_s>Advantages under "Marry" included "constant companion and a friend in old age ... better than a dog anyhow", against points such as "less money for books" and "terrible loss of time".<ch_s>Having decided in favour of marriage, he discussed it with his father, then went to visit his cousin Emma on 29 July.<ch_s>At this time he did not get around to proposing, but against his father's advice, he mentioned his ideas on transmutation.
<ch_s>He married Emma on 29 January 1839 and they were the parents of ten children, seven of whom survived to adulthood.


<ch_s>=== Malthus and natural selection ===
Continuing his research in London, Darwin's wide reading now included the sixth edition of Malthus's An Essay on the Principle of Population.<ch_s>On 28 September 1838, he noted its assertion that human "population, when unchecked, goes on doubling itself every twenty-five years, or increases in a geometrical ratio", a geometric progression so that population soon exceeds food supply in what is known as a Malthusian catastrophe.<ch_s>Darwin was well-prepared to compare this to Augustin de Candolle's "warring of the species" of plants and the struggle for existence among wildlife, explaining how numbers of a species kept roughly stable.<ch_s>As species always breed beyond available resources, favourable variations would make organisms better at surviving and passing the variations on to their offspring, while unfavourable variations would be lost.<ch_s>He wrote that the "final cause of all this wedging, must be to sort out proper structure, & adapt it to changes", so that "One may say there is a force like a hundred thousand wedges trying [to] force into every kind of adapted structure into the gaps in the economy of nature, or rather forming gaps by thrusting out weaker ones."<ch_s>This would result in the formation of new species.<ch_s>As he later wrote in his Autobiography:

In October 1838, that is, fifteen months after I had begun my systematic enquiry, I happened to read for amusement Malthus on Population, and being well prepared to appreciate the struggle for existence which everywhere goes on from long-continued observation of the habits of animals and plants, it at once struck me that under these circumstances favourable variations would tend to be preserved, and unfavourable ones to be destroyed.<ch_s>The result of this would be the formation of new species.<ch_s>Here, then, I had at last got a theory by which to work...
By mid-December, Darwin saw a similarity between farmers picking the best stock in selective breeding, and a Malthusian Nature selecting from chance variants so that "every part of newly acquired structure is fully practical and perfected", thinking this comparison "a beautiful part of my theory".<ch_s>He later called his theory natural selection, an analogy with what he termed the "artificial selection" of selective breeding.
<ch_s>On 11 November, he returned to Maer and proposed to Emma, once more telling her his ideas.<ch_s>She accepted, then in exchanges of loving letters showed how she valued his openness in sharing their differences, while expressing her strong Unitarian beliefs and concerns that his honest doubts might separate them in the afterlife.<ch_s>While he was house-hunting in London, bouts of illness continued and Emma wrote urging him to get some rest, almost prophetically remarking "So don't be ill any more my dear Charley till I can be with you to nurse you."<ch_s>He found what they called "Macaw Cottage" (because of its gaudy interiors) in Gower Street, then moved his "museum" in over Christmas.<ch_s>On 24 January 1839, Darwin was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS).
<ch_s>On 29 January, Darwin and Emma Wedgwood were married at Maer in an Anglican ceremony arranged to suit the Unitarians, then immediately caught the train to London and their new home.


<ch_s>=== Geology books, barnacles, evolutionary research ===

Darwin now had the framework of his theory of natural selection "by which to work", as his "prime hobby".<ch_s>His research included extensive experimental selective breeding of plants and animals, finding evidence that species were not fixed and investigating many detailed ideas to refine and substantiate his theory.<ch_s>For fifteen years this work was in the background to his main occupation of writing on geology and publishing expert reports on the Beagle collections, in particular, the barnacles. 
<ch_s>The impetus of Darwin's barnacle research came from a collection of a barnacle colony from Chile in 1835, which he dubbed Mr. Arthrobalanus.<ch_s>His confusion over the relationship of this species (Cryptophialus minutus) to other barnacles caused him to fixate on the systematics of the taxa.<ch_s>He wrote his first examination of the species in 1846 but did not formally describe it until 1854.
<ch_s>FitzRoy's long-delayed Narrative was published in May 1839.<ch_s>Darwin's Journal and Remarks got good reviews as the third volume, and on 15 August it was published on its own.<ch_s>Early in 1842, Darwin wrote about his ideas to Charles Lyell, who noted that his ally "denies seeing a beginning to each crop of species".
<ch_s>Darwin's book The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs on his theory of atoll formation was published in May 1842 after more than three years of work, and he then wrote his first "pencil sketch" of his theory of natural selection.<ch_s>To escape the pressures of London, the family moved to rural Down House in Kent in September.<ch_s>On 11 January 1844, Darwin mentioned his theorising to the botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker, writing with melodramatic humour "it is like confessing a murder".<ch_s>Hooker replied, "There may, in my opinion, have been a series of productions on different spots, & also a gradual change of species.<ch_s>I shall be delighted to hear how you think that this change may have taken place, as no presently conceived opinions satisfy me on the subject.<ch_s>"

By July, Darwin had expanded his "sketch" into a 230-page "Essay", to be expanded with his research results if he died prematurely.<ch_s>In November, the anonymously published sensational best-seller Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation brought wide interest in transmutation.<ch_s>Darwin scorned its amateurish geology and zoology, but carefully reviewed his own arguments.<ch_s>Controversy erupted, and it continued to sell well despite contemptuous dismissal by scientists.
<ch_s>Darwin completed his third geological book in 1846.<ch_s>He now renewed a fascination and expertise in marine invertebrates, dating back to his student days with Grant, by dissecting and classifying the barnacles he had collected on the voyage, enjoying observing beautiful structures and thinking about comparisons with allied structures.<ch_s>In 1847, Hooker read the "Essay" and sent notes that provided Darwin with the calm critical feedback that he needed, but would not commit himself and questioned Darwin's opposition to continuing acts of creation.
<ch_s>In an attempt to improve his chronic ill health, Darwin went in 1849 to Dr. James Gully's Malvern spa and was surprised to find some benefit from hydrotherapy.<ch_s>Then, in 1851, his treasured daughter Annie fell ill, reawakening his fears that his illness might be hereditary.<ch_s>She died the same year after a long series of crises.
<ch_s>In eight years of work on barnacles, Darwin's theory helped him to find "homologies" showing that slightly changed body parts served different functions to meet new conditions, and in some genera he found minute males parasitic on hermaphrodites, showing an intermediate stage in evolution of distinct sexes.<ch_s>In 1853, it earned him the Royal Society's Royal Medal, and it made his reputation as a biologist.<ch_s>Upon the conclusion of his research, Darwin declared "I hate a barnacle as no man ever did before."<ch_s>In 1854, he became a Fellow of the Linnean Society of London, gaining postal access to its library.<ch_s>He began a major reassessment of his theory of species, and in November realised that divergence in the character of descendants could be explained by them becoming adapted to "diversified places in the economy of nature".


<ch_s>=== Publication of the theory of natural selection ===

By the start of 1856, Darwin was investigating whether eggs and seeds could survive travel across seawater to spread species across oceans.<ch_s>Hooker increasingly doubted the traditional view that species were fixed, but their young friend Thomas Henry Huxley was still firmly against the transmutation of species.<ch_s>Lyell was intrigued by Darwin's speculations without realising their extent.<ch_s>When he read a paper by Alfred Russel Wallace, "On the Law which has Regulated the Introduction of New Species", he saw similarities with Darwin's thoughts and urged him to publish to establish precedence.
<ch_s>Though Darwin saw no threat, on 14<ch_s>May 1856 he began writing a short paper.<ch_s>Finding answers to difficult questions held him up repeatedly, and he expanded his plans to a "big book on species" titled Natural Selection, which was to include his "note on Man".<ch_s>He continued his research, obtaining information and specimens from naturalists worldwide, including Wallace who was working in Borneo.
<ch_s>In mid-1857, he added a section heading, "Theory applied to Races of Man", but did not add text on this topic.<ch_s>On 5 September 1857, Darwin sent the American botanist Asa Gray a detailed outline of his ideas, including an abstract of Natural Selection, which omitted human origins and sexual selection.<ch_s>In December, Darwin received a letter from Wallace asking if the book would examine human origins.<ch_s>He responded that he would avoid that subject, "so surrounded with prejudices", while encouraging Wallace's theorising and adding that "I go much further than you.<ch_s>"
Darwin's book was only partly written when, on 18 June 1858, he received a paper from Wallace describing natural selection.<ch_s>Shocked that he had been "forestalled", Darwin sent it on that day to Lyell, as requested by Wallace, and although Wallace had not asked for publication, Darwin suggested he would send it to any journal that Wallace chose.<ch_s>His family was in crisis, with children in the village dying of scarlet fever, and he put matters in the hands of his friends.<ch_s>After some discussion, with no reliable way of involving Wallace, Lyell and Hooker decided on a joint presentation at the Linnean Society on 1 July of On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection.<ch_s>On the evening of 28 June, Darwin's baby son died of scarlet fever after almost a week of severe illness, and he was too distraught to attend.
<ch_s>There was little immediate attention to this announcement of the theory; the president of the Linnean Society remarked in May 1859 that the year had not been marked by any revolutionary discoveries.<ch_s>Only one review rankled enough for Darwin to recall it later; Professor Samuel Haughton of Dublin claimed that "all that was new in them was false, and what was true was old".<ch_s>Darwin struggled for thirteen months to produce an abstract of his "big book", suffering from ill health but getting constant encouragement from his scientific friends.<ch_s>Lyell arranged to have it published by John Murray.
<ch_s>On the Origin of Species proved unexpectedly popular, with the entire stock of 1,250 copies oversubscribed when it went on sale to booksellers on 22 November 1859.<ch_s>In the book, Darwin set out "one long argument" of detailed observations, inferences and consideration of anticipated objections.<ch_s>In making the case for common descent, he included evidence of homologies between humans and other mammals.[III]<ch_s>Having outlined sexual selection, he hinted that it could explain differences between human races.[IV]<ch_s>He avoided explicit discussion of human origins, but implied the significance of his work with the sentence; "Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history.<ch_s>"[IV]<ch_s>His theory is simply stated in the introduction:

As many more individuals of each species are born than can possibly survive; and as, consequently, there is a frequently recurring struggle for existence, it follows that any being, if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself, under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life, will have a better chance of surviving, and thus be naturally selected.<ch_s>From the strong principle of inheritance, any selected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form.
<ch_s>At the end of the book, he concluded that:

There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.
<ch_s>The last word was the only variant of "evolved" in the first five editions of the book.<ch_s>"Evolutionism" at that time was associated with other concepts, most commonly with embryological development.<ch_s>Darwin first used the word evolution in The Descent of Man in 1871, before adding it in 1872 to the 6th edition of The Origin of Species.


<ch_s>=== Responses to publication ===

The book aroused international interest, with less controversy than had greeted the popular and less scientific Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation.<ch_s>Though Darwin's illness kept him away from the public debates, he eagerly scrutinised the scientific response, commenting on press cuttings, reviews, articles, satires and caricatures, and corresponded on it with colleagues worldwide.<ch_s>The book did not explicitly discuss human origins,[IV] but included a number of hints about the animal ancestry of humans from which the inference could be made.
<ch_s>The first review asked, "If a monkey has become a man – what may not a man become?"<ch_s>It said this should be left to theologians as being too dangerous for ordinary readers.<ch_s>Among early favourable responses, Huxley's reviews swiped at Richard Owen, leader of the scientific establishment which Huxley was trying to overthrow.
<ch_s>In April, Owen's review attacked Darwin's friends and condescendingly dismissed his ideas, angering Darwin, but Owen and others began to promote ideas of supernaturally guided evolution.<ch_s>Patrick Matthew drew attention to his 1831 book which had a brief appendix suggesting a concept of natural selection leading to new species, but he had not developed the idea.
<ch_s>The Church of England's response was mixed.<ch_s>Darwin's old Cambridge tutors Sedgwick and Henslow dismissed the ideas, but liberal clergymen interpreted natural selection as an instrument of God's design, with the cleric Charles Kingsley seeing it as "just as noble a conception of Deity".<ch_s>In 1860, the publication of Essays and Reviews by seven liberal Anglican theologians diverted clerical attention from Darwin.<ch_s>Its ideas, including higher criticism, were attacked by church authorities as heresy.<ch_s>In it, Baden Powell argued that miracles broke God's laws, so belief in them was atheistic, and praised "Mr Darwin's masterly volume [supporting] the grand principle of the self-evolving powers of nature".
<ch_s>Asa Gray discussed teleology with Darwin, who imported and distributed Gray's pamphlet on theistic evolution, Natural Selection is not inconsistent with natural theology.<ch_s>The most famous confrontation was at the public 1860 Oxford evolution debate during a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, where the Bishop of Oxford Samuel Wilberforce, though not opposed to transmutation of species, argued against Darwin's explanation and human descent from apes.<ch_s>Joseph Hooker argued strongly for Darwin, and Thomas Huxley's legendary retort, that he would rather be descended from an ape than a man who misused his gifts, came to symbolise a triumph of science over religion.
<ch_s>Even Darwin's close friends Gray, Hooker, Huxley and Lyell still expressed various reservations but gave strong support, as did many others, particularly younger naturalists.<ch_s>Gray and Lyell sought reconciliation with faith, while Huxley portrayed a polarisation between religion and science.<ch_s>He campaigned pugnaciously against the authority of the clergy in education, aiming to overturn the dominance of clergymen and aristocratic amateurs under Owen in favour of a new generation of professional scientists.<ch_s>Owen's claim that brain anatomy proved humans to be a separate biological order from apes was shown to be false by Huxley in a long-running dispute parodied by Kingsley as the "Great Hippocampus Question", and discredited Owen.
<ch_s>In response to objections that the origin of life was unexplained, Darwin pointed to acceptance of Newton's law even though the cause of gravity was unknown.<ch_s>Despite criticisms and reservations related to this topic, he nevertheless proposed a prescient idea in an 1871 letter to Hooker in which he suggested the origin of life may have occurred in a "warm little pond".
<ch_s>Darwinism became a movement covering a wide range of evolutionary ideas.<ch_s>In 1863, Lyell's Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man popularised prehistory, though his caution on evolution disappointed Darwin.<ch_s>Weeks later Huxley's Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature showed that anatomically, humans are apes, then The Naturalist on the River Amazons by Henry Walter Bates provided empirical evidence of natural selection.<ch_s>Lobbying brought Darwin Britain's highest scientific honour, the Royal Society's Copley Medal, awarded on 3 November 1864.<ch_s>That day, Huxley held the first meeting of what became the influential "X Club" devoted to "science, pure and free, untrammelled by religious dogmas".<ch_s>By the end of the decade, most scientists agreed that evolution occurred, but only a minority supported Darwin's view that the chief mechanism was natural selection.
<ch_s>The Origin of Species was translated into many languages, becoming a staple scientific text attracting thoughtful attention from all walks of life, including the "working men" who flocked to Huxley's lectures.<ch_s>Darwin's theory resonated with various movements at the time[V] and became a key fixture of popular culture.[VI]<ch_s>Cartoonists parodied animal ancestry in an old tradition of showing humans with animal traits, and in Britain, these droll images served to popularise Darwin's theory in an unthreatening way.<ch_s>While ill in 1862, Darwin began growing a beard, and when he reappeared in public in 1866, caricatures of him as an ape helped to identify all forms of evolutionism with Darwinism.
<ch_s>Othniel C. Marsh, America's first palaeontologist, was the first to provide solid fossil evidence to support Darwin's theory of evolution by unearthing the ancestors of the modern horse.  <ch_s>In 1877, Marsh delivered a very influential speech before the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, providing a demonstrative argument for evolution.  <ch_s>For the first time, Marsh traced the evolution of vertebrates from fish all the way through humans.  <ch_s>Sparing no detail, he listed a wealth of fossil examples of past life forms.  <ch_s>The significance of this speech was immediately recognized by the scientific community, and it was printed in its entirety in several scientific journals.


<ch_s>=== Descent of Man, sexual selection, and botany ===

Despite repeated bouts of illness during the last twenty-two years of his life, Darwin's work continued.<ch_s>Having published On the Origin of Species as an abstract of his theory, he pressed on with experiments, research, and writing of his "big book".<ch_s>He covered human descent from earlier animals, including the evolution of society and of mental abilities, as well as explaining decorative beauty in wildlife and diversifying into innovative plant studies.
<ch_s>Enquiries about insect pollination led in 1861 to novel studies of wild orchids, showing adaptation of their flowers to attract specific moths to each species and ensure cross fertilisation.<ch_s>In 1862, Fertilisation of Orchids gave his first detailed demonstration of the power of natural selection to explain complex ecological relationships, making testable predictions.<ch_s>As his health declined, he lay on his sickbed in a room filled with inventive experiments to trace the movements of climbing plants.<ch_s>Admiring visitors included Ernst Haeckel, a zealous proponent of Darwinism incorporating Lamarckism and Goethe's idealism.<ch_s>Wallace remained supportive, though he increasingly turned to Spiritualism.
<ch_s>Darwin's book The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication (1868) was the first part of his planned "big book", and included his unsuccessful hypothesis of pangenesis attempting to explain heredity.<ch_s>It sold briskly at first, despite its size, and was translated into many languages.<ch_s>He wrote most of a second part, on natural selection, but it remained unpublished in his lifetime.
<ch_s>Lyell had already popularised human prehistory, and Huxley had shown that anatomically humans are apes.<ch_s>With The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex published in 1871, Darwin set out evidence from numerous sources that humans are animals, showing continuity of physical and mental attributes, and presented sexual selection to explain impractical animal features such as the peacock's plumage as well as human evolution of culture, differences between sexes, and physical and cultural racial classification, while emphasising that humans are all one species.<ch_s>According to an editorial in Nature journal: "Although Charles Darwin opposed slavery and proposed that humans have a common ancestor, he also advocated a hierarchy of races, with white people higher than others.<ch_s>"

His research using images was expanded in his 1872 book The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, one of the first books to feature printed photographs, which discussed the evolution of human psychology and its continuity with the behaviour of animals.<ch_s>Both books proved very popular, and Darwin was impressed by the general assent with which his views had been received, remarking that "everybody is talking about it without being shocked."<ch_s>His conclusion was "that man with all his noble qualities, with sympathy which feels for the most debased, with benevolence which extends not only to other men but to the humblest living creature, with his god-like intellect which has penetrated into the movements and constitution of the solar system – with all these exalted powers – Man still bears in his bodily frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin.<ch_s>"
His evolution-related experiments and investigations led to books on Insectivorous Plants, The Effects of Cross and Self Fertilisation in the Vegetable Kingdom, different forms of flowers on plants of the same species, and The Power of Movement in Plants.<ch_s>He continued to collect information and exchange views from scientific correspondents all over the world, including Mary Treat, whom he encouraged to persevere in her scientific work.<ch_s>He was the first person to recognise the significance of carnivory in plants.<ch_s>His botanical work[IX] was interpreted and popularised by various writers including Grant Allen and H. G. Wells, and helped transform plant science in the late 19th century and early 20th century.


<ch_s>=== Death and funeral ===

In 1882, he was diagnosed with what was called "angina pectoris" which then meant coronary thrombosis and disease of the heart.<ch_s>At the time of his death, the physicians diagnosed "anginal attacks", and "heart-failure"; there has since been scholarly speculation about his life-long health issues.
<ch_s>He died at Down House on 19 April 1882.<ch_s>His last words were to his family, telling Emma, "I am not the least afraid of death—Remember what a good wife you have been to me—Tell all my children to remember how good they have been to me".<ch_s>While she rested, he repeatedly told Henrietta and Francis, "It's almost worthwhile to be sick to be nursed by you".
<ch_s>He had expected to be buried in St Mary's churchyard at Downe, but at the request of Darwin's colleagues, after public and parliamentary petitioning, William Spottiswoode (President of the Royal Society) arranged for Darwin to be honoured by burial in Westminster Abbey, close to John Herschel and Isaac Newton.<ch_s>The funeral, held on Wednesday 26 April, was attended by thousands of people, including family, friends, scientists, philosophers and dignitaries.


<ch_s>== Children ==

The Darwins had ten children: two died in infancy, and Annie's death at the age of ten had a devastating effect on her parents.<ch_s>Charles was a devoted father and uncommonly attentive to his children.<ch_s>Whenever they fell ill, he feared that they might have inherited weaknesses from inbreeding due to the close family ties he shared with his wife and cousin, Emma Wedgwood.<ch_s>He examined inbreeding in his writings, contrasting it with the advantages of outcrossing in many species.

<ch_s>Charles Waring Darwin, born in December 1856, was the tenth and last of the children.<ch_s>Emma Darwin was aged 48 at the time of the birth, and the child was mentally subnormal and never learnt to walk or talk.<ch_s>He probably had Down syndrome, which had not then been medically described.<ch_s>The evidence is a photograph by William Erasmus Darwin of the infant and his mother, showing a characteristic head shape, and the family's observations of the child.<ch_s>Charles Waring died of scarlet fever on 28 June 1858, when Darwin wrote in his journal: "Poor dear Baby died." 
<ch_s>Of his surviving children, George, Francis and Horace became Fellows of the Royal Society, distinguished as an astronomer, botanist and civil engineer, respectively.<ch_s>All three were knighted.<ch_s>Another son, Leonard, went on to be a soldier, politician, economist, eugenicist, and mentor of the statistician and evolutionary biologist Ronald Fisher.


<ch_s>== Views and opinions ==


=== Religious views ===

Darwin's family tradition was nonconformist Unitarianism, while his father and grandfather were freethinkers, and his baptism and boarding school were Church of England.<ch_s>When going to Cambridge to become an Anglican clergyman, he did not "in the least doubt the strict and literal truth of every word in the Bible".<ch_s>He learned John Herschel's science which, like William Paley's natural theology, sought explanations in laws of nature rather than miracles and saw adaptation of species as evidence of design.<ch_s>On board HMS Beagle, Darwin was quite orthodox and would quote the Bible as an authority on morality.<ch_s>He looked for "centres of creation" to explain distribution, and suggested that the very similar antlions found in Australia and England were evidence of a divine hand.

<ch_s>Upon his return, he expressed a critical view of the Bible's historical accuracy and questioned the basis for considering one religion more valid than another.<ch_s>In the next few years, while intensively speculating on geology and the transmutation of species, he gave much thought to religion and openly discussed this with his wife Emma, whose beliefs similarly came from intensive study and questioning.
<ch_s>The theodicy of Paley and Thomas Malthus vindicated evils such as starvation as a result of a benevolent creator's laws, which had an overall good effect.<ch_s>To Darwin, natural selection produced the good of adaptation but removed the need for design, and he could not see the work of an omnipotent deity in all the pain and suffering, such as the ichneumon wasp paralysing caterpillars as live food for its eggs.<ch_s>Though he thought of religion as a tribal survival strategy, Darwin was reluctant to give up the idea of God as an ultimate lawgiver.<ch_s>He was increasingly troubled by the problem of evil.
<ch_s>Darwin remained close friends with the vicar of Downe, John Brodie Innes, and continued to play a leading part in the parish work of the church, but from c. 1849 would go for a walk on Sundays while his family attended church.<ch_s>He considered it "absurd to doubt that a man might be an ardent theist and an evolutionist" and, though reticent about his religious views, in 1879 he wrote that "I have never been an atheist in the sense of denying the existence of a God.<ch_s>– I think that generally ... an agnostic would be the most correct description of my state of mind".
<ch_s>The "Lady Hope Story", published in 1915, claimed that Darwin had reverted to Christianity on his sickbed.<ch_s>The claims were repudiated by Darwin's children and have been dismissed as false by historians.


<ch_s>=== Human society ===
Darwin's views on social and political issues reflected his time and social position.<ch_s>He grew up in a family of Whig reformers who, like his uncle Josiah Wedgwood, supported electoral reform and the emancipation of slaves.<ch_s>Darwin was passionately opposed to slavery, while seeing no problem with the working conditions of English factory workers or servants.
<ch_s>Taking taxidermy lessons in 1826 from the freed slave John Edmonstone, whom Darwin long recalled as "a very pleasant and intelligent man", reinforced his belief that black people shared the same feelings, and could be as intelligent as people of other races.<ch_s>He took the same attitude to native people he met on the Beagle voyage.<ch_s>Though commonplace in Britain at the time, Silliman and Bachman noticed the contrast with slave-owning America.<ch_s>Around twenty years later, racism became a feature of British society, but Darwin remained strongly against slavery, against "ranking the so-called races of man as distinct species", and against ill-treatment of native people.[VII]
Darwin's interaction with Yaghans (Fuegians) such as Jemmy Button during the second voyage of HMS Beagle had a profound impact on his view of indigenous peoples.<ch_s>At his arrival in Tierra del Fuego he made a colourful description of "Fuegian savages".<ch_s>This view changed as he came to know Yaghan people more in detail.<ch_s>By studying the Yaghans, Darwin concluded that a number of basic emotions by different human groups were the same and that mental capabilities were roughly the same as for Europeans.<ch_s>While interested in Yaghan culture, Darwin failed to appreciate their deep ecological knowledge and elaborate cosmology until the 1850s when he inspected a dictionary of Yaghan detailing 32,000 words.<ch_s>He saw that European colonisation would often lead to the extinction of native civilisations, and "tr[ied] to integrate colonialism into an evolutionary history of civilization analogous to natural history".
<ch_s>Darwin's view of women was that men's eminence over them was the outcome of sexual selection, a view disputed by Antoinette Brown Blackwell in her 1875 book The Sexes Throughout Nature.
<ch_s>Darwin was intrigued by his half-cousin Francis Galton's argument, introduced in 1865, that statistical analysis of heredity showed that moral and mental human traits could be inherited, and principles of animal breeding could apply to humans.<ch_s>In The Descent of Man, Darwin noted that aiding the weak to survive and have families could lose the benefits of natural selection, but cautioned that withholding such aid would endanger the instinct of sympathy, "the noblest part of our nature", and factors such as education could be more important.<ch_s>When Galton suggested that publishing research could encourage intermarriage within a "caste" of "those who are naturally gifted", Darwin foresaw practical difficulties and thought it "the sole feasible, yet I fear utopian, plan of procedure in improving the human race", preferring to simply publicise the importance of inheritance and leave decisions to individuals.<ch_s>Francis Galton named this field of study "eugenics" in 1883,[VIII] after Darwin's death, and his theories were cited to promote eugenic policies.


<ch_s>== Evolutionary social movements ==

Darwin's fame and popularity led to his name being associated with ideas and movements that, at times, had only an indirect relation to his writings, and sometimes went directly against his express comments.
<ch_s>Thomas Malthus had argued that population growth beyond resources was ordained by God to get humans to work productively and show restraint in getting families; this was used in the 1830s to justify workhouses and laissez-faire economics.<ch_s>Evolution was by then seen as having social implications, and Herbert Spencer's 1851 book Social Statics based ideas of human freedom and individual liberties on his Lamarckian evolutionary theory.
<ch_s>Soon after the Origin was published in 1859, critics derided his description of a struggle for existence as a Malthusian justification for the English industrial capitalism of the time.<ch_s>The term Darwinism was used for the evolutionary ideas of others, including Spencer's "survival of the fittest" as free-market progress, and Ernst Haeckel's polygenistic ideas of human development.<ch_s>Writers used natural selection to argue for various, often contradictory, ideologies such as laissez-faire dog-eat-dog capitalism, colonialism and imperialism.<ch_s>However, Darwin's holistic view of nature included "dependence of one being on another"; thus pacifists, socialists, liberal social reformers and anarchists such as Peter Kropotkin stressed the value of cooperation over struggle within a species.<ch_s>Darwin himself insisted that social policy should not simply be guided by concepts of struggle and selection in nature.
<ch_s>After the 1880s, a eugenics movement developed on ideas of biological inheritance, and for scientific justification of their ideas appealed to some concepts of Darwinism.<ch_s>In Britain, most shared Darwin's cautious views on voluntary improvement and sought to encourage those with good traits in "positive eugenics".<ch_s>During the "Eclipse of Darwinism", a scientific foundation for eugenics was provided by Mendelian genetics.<ch_s>Negative eugenics to remove the "feebleminded" were popular in America, Canada and Australia, and eugenics in the United States introduced compulsory sterilisation laws, followed by several other countries.<ch_s>Subsequently, Nazi eugenics brought the field into disrepute.[VIII]
The term "Social Darwinism" was used infrequently from around the 1890s, but became popular as a derogatory term in the 1940s when used by Richard Hofstadter to attack the laissez-faire conservatism of those like William Graham Sumner who opposed reform and socialism.<ch_s>Since then, it has been used as a term of abuse by those opposed to what they think are the moral consequences of evolution.


<ch_s>== Works ==

Darwin was a prolific writer.<ch_s>Even without the publication of his works on evolution, he would have had a considerable reputation as the author of The Voyage of the Beagle, as a geologist who had published extensively on South America and had solved the puzzle of the formation of coral atolls, and as a biologist who had published the definitive work on barnacles.<ch_s>While On the Origin of Species dominates perceptions of his work, The Descent of Man and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals had considerable impact, and his books on plants including The Power of Movement in Plants were innovative studies of great importance, as was his final work on The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms.


<ch_s>== Legacy and commemoration ==

As Alfred Russel Wallace put it, Darwin had "wrought a greater revolution in human thought within a quarter of a century than any man of our time – or perhaps any time", having "given us a new conception of the world of life, and a theory which is itself a powerful instrument of research; has shown us how to combine into one consistent whole the facts accumulated by all the separate classes of workers, and has thereby revolutionised the whole study of nature".<ch_s>The paleoanthropologist Trenton Holliday states that "Darwin is rightly considered to be the preeminent evolutionary scientist of all time".
<ch_s>By around 1880, most scientists were convinced of evolution as descent with modification, though few agreed with Darwin that natural selection "has been the main but not the exclusive means of modification".<ch_s>During "the eclipse of Darwinism" scientists explored alternative mechanisms.<ch_s>Then Ronald Fisher incorporated Mendelian genetics in The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection, leading to population genetics and the modern evolutionary synthesis, which continues to develop.<ch_s>Scientific discoveries have confirmed and validated Darwin's key insights.
<ch_s>Geographical features given his name include Darwin Sound and Mount Darwin, both named while he was on the Beagle voyage, and Darwin Harbour, named by his former shipmates on its next voyage, which eventually became the location of Darwin, the capital city of Australia's Northern Territory.<ch_s>Darwin's name was given, formally or informally, to numerous plants and animals, including many he had collected on the voyage.<ch_s>The Linnean Society of London began awards of the Darwin–Wallace Medal in 1908, to mark fifty years from the joint reading on 1 July 1858 of papers by Darwin and Wallace publishing their theory.<ch_s>Further awards were made in 1958 and 2008; since 2010, the awards have been annual.<ch_s>Darwin College, a postgraduate college at Cambridge University founded in 1964, is named after the Darwin family.<ch_s>From 2000 to 2017, UK £10 banknotes issued by the Bank of England featured Darwin's portrait printed on the reverse, along with a hummingbird and HMS Beagle.

<ch_s>Westminster Abbey, formally titled the Collegiate Church of Saint Peter at Westminster, is an Anglican church in the City of Westminster, London, England.<ch_s>Since 1066, it has been the location of the coronations of 40 English and British monarchs and a burial site for 18 English, Scottish, and British monarchs.<ch_s>At least 16 royal weddings have taken place at the abbey since 1100.
<ch_s>Although the origins of the church are obscure, an abbey housing Benedictine monks was on the site by the mid-10th century.<ch_s>The church got its first large building from the 1040s, commissioned by King Edward the Confessor, who is buried inside.<ch_s>Construction of the present church began in 1245 on the orders of Henry III.<ch_s>The monastery was dissolved in 1559, and the church was made a royal peculiar – a Church of England church, accountable directly to the sovereign – by Elizabeth I.<ch_s>The abbey, the Palace of Westminster and St Margaret's Church became a UNESCO<ch_s>World Heritage Site in 1987 because of their historic and symbolic significance.
<ch_s>The church's Gothic architecture is chiefly inspired by 13th-century French and English styles, although some sections of the church have earlier Romanesque styles or later Baroque and modern styles.<ch_s>The Henry VII Chapel, at the east end of the church, is a typical example of Perpendicular Gothic architecture; antiquarian John Leland called it orbis miraculum ("the wonder of the world").
<ch_s>The abbey is the burial site of more than 3,300 people, many prominent in British history: monarchs, prime ministers, poets laureate, actors, musicians, scientists, military leaders, and the Unknown Warrior.<ch_s>Due to the fame of the figures buried there, artist William Morris described the abbey as a "National Valhalla".


<ch_s>== History ==
Historians agree that there was a monastery dedicated to Saint Peter on the site prior to the 11th century, though its exact origin is somewhat obscure.<ch_s>One legend claims that it was founded by the Saxon king Sæberht of Essex, and another claims that its founder was the fictional 2nd-century British king Lucius.<ch_s>One tradition claims that a young fisherman on the River Thames had a vision of Saint Peter near the site.<ch_s>This seems to have been quoted as the origin of the salmon that Thames fishermen offered to the abbey, a custom still observed annually by the Fishmongers' Company.
<ch_s>The origins of the abbey are generally thought to date to about 959, when Dunstan and King Edgar installed a community of Benedictine monks on the site.<ch_s>At that time, the location was an island in the Thames called Thorney Island.<ch_s>This building has not survived, but archaeologists have found some pottery and foundations from this period on the abbey site.


<ch_s>=== Edward the Confessor's abbey ===
Between 1042 and 1052, Edward the Confessor began rebuilding Saint Peter's Abbey to provide himself with a royal burial church.<ch_s>It was built in the Romanesque style and was the first church in England built on a cruciform floorplan.<ch_s>The master stonemason for the project was Leofsi Duddason, with Godwin and Wendelburh Gretsyd (meaning "fat purse") as patrons, and Teinfrith as "churchwright", probably meaning someone who worked on the carpentry and roofing.<ch_s>Endowments from Edward supported a community that increased from a dozen monks during Dunstan's time, to as many as 80.<ch_s>The building was completed around 1060 and was consecrated on 28 December 1065, about a week before Edward's death on 5 January 1066.<ch_s>A week later, he was buried in the church; nine years later, his wife Edith was buried alongside him.<ch_s>His successor, Harold Godwinson, was probably crowned here, although the first documented coronation is that of William the Conqueror later that year.
<ch_s>The only extant depiction of Edward's abbey is in the Bayeux Tapestry.<ch_s>The foundations still survive under the present church, and above ground, some of the lower parts of the monastic dormitory survive in the undercroft, including a door said to come from the previous Anglo-Saxon abbey.<ch_s>It was a little smaller than the current church, with a central tower.
<ch_s>In 1103, thirty-seven years after his death, Edward's tomb was re-opened by Abbot Gilbert Crispin and Henry I, who discovered that his body was still in perfect condition.<ch_s>This was considered proof of his saintliness, and he was canonised in 1161.<ch_s>Two years later he was moved to a new shrine, during which time his ring was removed and placed in the abbey's collection.
<ch_s>The abbey became more closely associated with royalty from the second half of the 12th century, as kings increasingly used the nearby Palace of Westminster as the seat of their governments.<ch_s>In 1222, the abbey was officially granted exemption from the Bishop of London's jurisdiction, making it answerable only to the head of the Church itself.<ch_s>By this time, the abbey owned a large swath of land around it, from modern-day Oxford Street to the Thames, plus entire parishes in the City of London, such as St Alban, Wood Street and St Magnus the Martyr, as well as several wharfs.
<ch_s>Outside London, the abbey owned estates across southeast England, including in Middlesex, Hertfordshire, Essex, Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire.<ch_s>The abbot was also the lord of the manor in Westminster, as a town of two to three thousand people grew around the abbey.<ch_s>As a consumer and employer on a grand scale, the abbey helped fuel the town's economy, and relations with the town remained unusually cordial, but no enfranchising charter was issued during the Middle Ages.


<ch_s>=== Henry III's rebuilding ===
Westminster Abbey continued to be used as a coronation site, but after Edward the Confessor, no monarchs were buried there until Henry III began to rebuild it in the Gothic style.<ch_s>Henry III wanted it built as a shrine to venerate Edward, to match great French churches such as Rheims Cathedral and Sainte-Chapelle, and as a burial place for himself and his family.<ch_s>Construction began on 6 July 1245 under Henry's master mason, Henry of Reynes.<ch_s>The first building stage included the entire eastern end, the transepts, and the easternmost bay of the nave.<ch_s>The Lady chapel, built from around 1220 at the extreme eastern end, was incorporated into the chevet of the new building.
<ch_s>Part of the new building included a rich shrine and chapel to Edward the Confessor, of which the base only still stands.  <ch_s>The golden shrine with its jewelled figures no longer exists.  <ch_s>4,000 marks (about £5,800) for this work came from the estate of David of Oxford, the husband of Licoricia of Winchester, and a further £2,500 came from a forced contribution from Licoricia herself, by far the biggest single donation at that time.
<ch_s>Around 1253, Henry of Reynes was replaced by John of Gloucester, who was replaced by Robert of Beverley around 1260.<ch_s>During the summer, there were up to 400 workers on the site at a time, including stonecutters, marblers, stone-layers, carpenters, painters and their assistants, marble polishers, smiths, glaziers, plumbers, and general labourers.<ch_s>From 1257, Henry III held assemblies of local representatives in Westminster Abbey's chapter house; these assemblies were a precursor to the House of Commons.<ch_s>Henry III also commissioned the Cosmati pavement in front of the High Altar.<ch_s>Further work produced an additional five bays for the nave, bringing it to one bay west of the choir.<ch_s>Here, construction stopped in about 1269.<ch_s>By 1261, Henry had spent £29,345 19s 8d on the abbey, and the final sum may have been near £50,000.<ch_s>A consecration ceremony was held on 13 October 1269, during which the remains of Edward the Confessor were moved to their present location at the shrine behind the main altar.<ch_s>After Henry's death and burial in the abbey in 1272, construction did not resume and Edward the Confessor's old Romanesque nave remained attached to the new building for over a century.

<ch_s>In 1296, Edward I captured the Scottish coronation stone, the Stone of Scone.<ch_s>He had a Coronation Chair made to hold it, which he entrusted to the abbot at Westminster Abbey.<ch_s>In 1303, the small crypt underneath the chapter house was broken into and a great deal of the king's treasure was stolen.<ch_s>It was thought that the thieves must have been helped by the abbey monks, fifty of whom were subsequently imprisoned in the Tower of London.


<ch_s>=== Completion of the Gothic church ===
From 1376, Abbot Nicholas Litlyngton and Richard II donated large sums to finish the church.<ch_s>The remainder of the old nave was pulled down and rebuilding commenced, with his mason Henry Yevele closely following the original design even though it was now more than 100 years out of date.<ch_s>During the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, Richard prayed at Edward the Confessor's shrine for "divine aid when human counsel was altogether wanting" before meeting the rebels at Smithfield.<ch_s>In the modern day, the abbey holds Richard's full-length portrait, the earliest of an English king, on display near the west door.
<ch_s>Building work was not fully complete for many years.<ch_s>Henry V, disappointed with the abbey's unfinished state, gave extra funds towards the rebuilding.<ch_s>In his will, he left instructions for a chantry chapel to be built over his tomb; the chapel can be seen from ground level.<ch_s>Between 1470 and 1471, because of fallout from the Wars of the Roses, Elizabeth Woodville, the wife of Edward IV, took sanctuary at Westminster Abbey while her husband was deposed, and gave birth to Edward V in the abbot's house.<ch_s>In 1495, building work finally reached the end of the nave, finishing with the west window.
<ch_s>Under Henry VII, the 13th-century Lady chapel was demolished and rebuilt in a Perpendicular Gothic style; it is known as the Henry VII Chapel.<ch_s>Work began in 1503 and the main structure was completed by 1509, although decorative work continued for several years afterwards.<ch_s>Henry's original reason for building such a grand chapel was to have a place suitable for the burial of another saint alongside the Confessor, as he planned on having Henry VI canonised.<ch_s>The Pope asked Henry VII for a large sum of money to proclaim Henry VI a saint; Henry VII was unwilling to pay the sum, and so instead he is buried in the centre of the chapel with his wife, Elizabeth of York, rather than a large raised shrine like the Confessor.
<ch_s>A view of the abbey dated 1532 shows a lantern tower above the crossing, but this is not shown in any later depiction.<ch_s>It is unlikely that the loss of this feature was caused by any catastrophic event: structural failure seems more likely.<ch_s>Other sources maintain that a lantern tower was never built.<ch_s>The current squat pyramid dates from the 18th century; the painted wooden ceiling below it was installed during repairs to World War II bomb damage.
<ch_s>In the early 16th century, a project began under Abbot John Islip to add two towers to the western end of the church.<ch_s>These had been partially built up to roof level when building work stopped due to uncertainty caused by the English Reformation.


<ch_s>=== Dissolution and Reformation ===
In the 1530s, Henry VIII broke away from the authority of the Catholic Church in Rome and seized control of England's monasteries, including Westminster Abbey, beginning the English Reformation.<ch_s>In 1535, when the king's officers assessed the abbey's funds, their annual income was £3,000.<ch_s>Henry's agents removed many relics, saints' images, and treasures from the abbey.<ch_s>The golden feretory that housed the coffin of Edward the Confessor was melted down, and monks hid his bones to save them from destruction.<ch_s>The monastery was dissolved and the building became the cathedral for the newly created Diocese of Westminster.<ch_s>The abbot, William Benson, became dean of the cathedral, while the prior and five of the monks were among the twelve newly created canons.
<ch_s>The Westminster diocese was dissolved in 1550, but the abbey was recognised (in 1552, retroactively to 1550) as a second cathedral of the Diocese of London until 1556.<ch_s>Money meant for the abbey, which is dedicated to St Peter, was diverted to the treasury of St Paul's Cathedral; this led to an association with the already-old saying "robbing Peter to pay Paul".
<ch_s>The abbey saw the return of Benedictine monks under the Catholic Mary I, but they were again ejected under Elizabeth I in 1559.<ch_s>In 1560, Elizabeth re-established Westminster as a "royal peculiar" – a church of the Church of England responsible directly to the sovereign, rather than to a diocesan bishop – and made it the Collegiate Church of Saint Peter, a non-cathedral church with an attached chapter of canons, headed by a dean.<ch_s>From that date onwards, the building was simply a church, though it was still called an abbey.<ch_s>Elizabeth also re-founded Westminster School, providing for 40 students (the King's (or Queen's) Scholars) and their schoolmasters.<ch_s>The King's Scholars have the duty of shouting Vivat Rex or Vivat Regina ("Long live the King/Queen") during the coronation of a new monarch.<ch_s>In the modern day, the dean of Westminster Abbey remains the chair of the school governors.
<ch_s>In the early 17th century, the abbey hosted two of the six companies of churchmen who produced the King James Version of the Bible.<ch_s>They used the Jerusalem Chamber in the abbey for their meetings.<ch_s>The First Company was headed by the dean of the abbey, Lancelot Andrewes.
<ch_s>In 1642, the English Civil War broke out between Charles I and his own parliament.<ch_s>The Dean and Chapter fled the abbey at the outbreak of war, and were replaced by priests loyal to Parliament.<ch_s>The abbey itself suffered damage during the war; altars, stained glass, the organ, and the Crown Jewels were damaged or destroyed.<ch_s>Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell was given an elaborate funeral there in 1658, only for a body thought to be Cromwell's to be disinterred in January 1661 and posthumously hanged from a gibbet at Tyburn.<ch_s>In 1669, the abbey was visited by the diarist Samuel Pepys, who saw the body of the 15th-century queen Catherine de Valois.<ch_s>She had been buried in the 13th-century Lady chapel in 1437, but was exhumed during building work for the Henry VII Chapel and not reburied in the intervening 150 years.<ch_s>Pepys leaned into the coffin and kissed her on the mouth, writing "This was my birthday, thirty-six years old and I did first kiss a queen."<ch_s>She has since been re-interred close to her husband, Henry V. In 1685, during preparations for the coronation of James II, a workman accidentally put a scaffolding pole through the coffin of Edward the Confessor.<ch_s>A chorister, Charles Taylour, pulled a cross on a chain out of the coffin and gave it to the king, who then gave it to the Pope.<ch_s>Its whereabouts are unknown.


<ch_s>=== 18th and 19th centuries ===

At the end of the 17th century, the architect Christopher Wren was appointed the abbey's first Surveyor of the Fabric.<ch_s>He began a project to restore the exterior of the church, which was continued by his successor, William Dickinson.<ch_s>After over two hundred years, the abbey's two western towers were built in the 1740s in a Gothic–Baroque style by Nicholas Hawksmoor and John James.
<ch_s>On 11 November 1760, the funeral of George II was held at the abbey, and the king was interred next to his late wife, Caroline of Ansbach.<ch_s>He left instructions for the sides of his and his wife's coffins to be removed so that their remains could mingle.<ch_s>He was the last monarch to be buried in the abbey.<ch_s>Around the same time, the tomb of Richard II developed a hole through which visitors could put their hands.<ch_s>Several of his bones went missing, including a jawbone which was taken by a boy from Westminster School and kept by his family until 1906, when it was returned to the abbey.
<ch_s>In the 1830s, the screen dividing the nave from the choir, which had been designed by Nicholas Hawksmoor, was replaced by one designed by Edward Blore.<ch_s>The screen contains the monuments to the scientist Isaac Newton and the military general James Stanhope.<ch_s>Further rebuilding and restoration occurred in the 19th century under the architect George Gilbert Scott, who rebuilt sections of the chapter house and north porches, and designed a new altar and reredos for the crossing.<ch_s>His successor, J. L. Pearson, finished the work on the north porches and also reconstructed the northern rose window.


<ch_s>=== 20th century ===

The abbey saw "Prayers For Prisoners" suffragette protests in 1913 and 1914.<ch_s>Protesters attended services and interrupted proceedings by chanting "God Save Mrs Pankhurst" and praying for suffragette prisoners.<ch_s>In one protest, a woman chained herself to her chair during a sermon by the Archbishop of Canterbury.<ch_s>On 11 June 1914, a bomb planted by suffragettes of the Women's Social and Political Union exploded inside the abbey.<ch_s>No serious injuries were reported, but the bomb blew off a corner of the Coronation Chair.<ch_s>It also caused the Stone of Scone to break in half, although this was not discovered until 1950 when four Scottish nationalists broke into the church to steal the stone and return it to Scotland.
<ch_s>In preparation for bombing raids during World War II, the Coronation Chair and many of the abbey's records were moved out of the city, and the Stone of Scone was buried.<ch_s>In 1941, on the night of 10 May and the early morning of 11 May, the Westminster Abbey precincts and roof were hit by incendiary bombs.<ch_s>Although the Auxiliary Fire Service and the abbey's own fire-watchers were able to stop the fire spreading to the whole of the church, the deanery and three residences of abbey clergy and staff were badly damaged, and the lantern tower above the crossing collapsed, leaving the abbey open to the sky.<ch_s>The cost of the damage was estimated at £135,000.<ch_s>Some damage can still be seen in the RAF Chapel, where a small hole in the wall was created by a bomb that fell outside the chapel.<ch_s>No one was killed, and the abbey continued to hold services throughout the war.<ch_s>When hostilities ceased, evacuated objects were returned to the abbey, 60,000 sandbags were moved out, and a new permanent roof was built over the crossing.<ch_s>Two different designs for a narthex (entrance hall) for the west front were produced by architects Edwin Lutyens and Edward Maufe during World War II, but neither was built.
<ch_s>Because of its outstanding universal value, the abbey was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987, together with the nearby Palace of Westminster and St Margaret's Church.
<ch_s>In 1997, the abbey, which was then receiving approximately 1.75 million visitors each year, began charging admission fees to visitors at the door (although a fee for entering the eastern half of the church had existed prior to 1600).


<ch_s>=== 21st century ===

In June 2009, the first major building work in 250 years was proposed.<ch_s>A corona – a crown-like architectural feature – was suggested to be built around the lantern over the central crossing, replacing an existing pyramidal structure dating from the 1950s.<ch_s>This was part of a wider £23-million development of the abbey completed in 2013.<ch_s>On 4 August 2010, the Dean and Chapter announced that, "after a considerable amount of preliminary and exploratory work", efforts toward the construction of a corona would not be continued.
<ch_s>The Cosmati pavement underwent a major cleaning and restoration programme for two years, beginning in 2008.<ch_s>On 17 September 2010, Pope Benedict XVI became the first pope to set foot in the abbey when he participated in a service of evening prayer with archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams.<ch_s>On 29 April 2011, the abbey hosted the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton.
<ch_s>In 2018, the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Galleries were opened.<ch_s>Located in the medieval triforium, high up around the sanctuary, they are areas for displaying the abbey's treasures.<ch_s>A new Gothic access tower with a lift was designed by the abbey architect and Surveyor of the Fabric, Ptolemy Dean.
<ch_s>In 2020, a 13th-century sacristy was uncovered in the grounds of the abbey as part of an archaeological excavation.<ch_s>The sacristy was used by the monks of the abbey to store objects used in Mass, such as vestments and chalices.<ch_s>Also on the site were hundreds of buried bodies, mostly of abbey monks.<ch_s>On 10 March 2021, a vaccination centre opened in Poets' Corner to administer doses of COVID-19 vaccines.


<ch_s>== Architecture ==

The building is chiefly built in a Geometric Gothic style, using Reigate stone for facings.<ch_s>The church has an eleven-bay nave with aisles, transepts, and a chancel with ambulatory and radiating chapels.<ch_s>The building is supported with two tiers of flying buttresses.<ch_s>The western end of the nave and the west front were designed by Henry Yevele in a Perpendicular Gothic style.<ch_s>The Henry VII Chapel was built in a late Perpendicular style in Huddlestone stone, probably by Robert and William Vertue.<ch_s>The west towers were designed by Nicholas Hawksmoor and blend the Gothic style of the abbey with the Baroque style fashionable during his lifetime.
<ch_s>The modern Westminster Abbey is largely based on French Gothic styles, especially those found at Reims Cathedral, rather than the contemporaneous English Gothic styles.<ch_s>For example, the English Gothic style favours large and elaborate towers, while Westminster Abbey did not have any towers until the 18th century.<ch_s>It is also more similar to French churches than English ones in terms of its ratio of height to width:<ch_s>Westminster Abbey has the highest nave of any Gothic church in England, and the nave is much narrower than any medieval English church of a similar height.<ch_s>Instead of a short, square, eastern end (as was the English fashion), Westminster Abbey has a long, rounded apse, and it also has chapels radiating from the ambulatory, which is typical of a French Gothic style.<ch_s>However, there are also distinctively English elements, such as the use of materials of contrasting colours, as with the Purbeck marble and white stone in the crossing.
<ch_s>The northern entrance has three porches, with the central one featuring an elaborately-carved tympanum, leading it to acquire the nickname "Solomon's porch" as a reference to the legendary temple in Jerusalem.
<ch_s>The abbey retains its 13th- and 14th-century cloisters, which would have been one of the busiest parts of the church when it was part of a monastery.<ch_s>The west cloister was used for the teaching of novice monks, the north for private study.<ch_s>The south cloister led to the refectory, and the east to the chapter house and dormitory.<ch_s>In the southwest corner of the cloisters is a cellarium formerly used by the monks to store food and wine; in modern times, it is the abbey café.<ch_s>The north cloister and northern end of the east cloister, closest to the church, are the oldest; they date to c. 1250, whereas the rest are from 1352 to 1366.<ch_s>The abbey also contains a Little Cloister, on the site of the monks' infirmary.<ch_s>The Little Cloister dates from the end of the 17th century and contains a small garden with a fountain in the centre.<ch_s>A passageway from the Little Cloister leads to College Garden, which has been in continuous use for 900 years, beginning as the medicine garden for the monks of the abbey and now overlooked by canons' houses and the dormitory for Westminster School.
<ch_s>The newest part of the abbey is the Weston Tower, finished in 2018 and designed by Ptolemy Dean.<ch_s>It sits between the chapter house and the Henry VII Chapel, and contains a lift shaft and spiral staircase to allow public access to the triforium, which contains the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Galleries.<ch_s>The tower has a star-shaped floorplan and leaded windows with an elaborate crown rooftop.<ch_s>The lift shaft inside is faced with 16 kinds of stone from the abbey's history, including Purbeck marble, Reigate stone, and Portland stone.<ch_s>The project took five years and cost £22.9 million.<ch_s>The galleries were designed by McInnes Usher McKnight.


<ch_s>=== Interior ===
The church's interior has Purbeck marble piers and shafting.<ch_s>The roof vaulting is quadripartite, with ridge ribs and bosses and, at 102 feet (31 m), it is one of Britain's highest church vaults.<ch_s>To accommodate as many guests as possible during coronations, the transepts were designed to be unusually long and the choir was placed east (rather than west) of the crossing; this is also seen in Rheims Cathedral.<ch_s>The 13th-century interior would have been painted in bright colours and gilded, although the piers would have been left unpainted.
<ch_s>Although the nave was built over the course of centuries from the east to the west end, generations of builders stuck to the original design and it has a unified style.<ch_s>Markers of the long gap in building between 1269 and 1376 are relatively minor, but can be seen at the fifth bay from the crossing.<ch_s>The spandrels above the arches towards the earlier east end are decorated with diaper-work, and are plain towards the (later) west end.<ch_s>The lancet windows on the earlier side have a foiled circle, and have an unencircled quatrefoil on the later side; the shields on the aisle walls are carved on the earlier side, and painted on the later side.<ch_s>Above the crossing, in the centre of the church, is a roof lantern which was destroyed by a bomb in 1941 and restored by architect Stephen Dykes Bower in 1958.<ch_s>In the choir aisles, shields of donors to the 13th- and 14th-century rebuilding are carved and painted in the spandrels of the arcade.<ch_s>At the eastern end of the nave is a large screen separating the nave from the choir, made of 13th-century stone, reworked by Edward Blore in 1834, and with paintwork and gilding by Bower in the 1960s.

<ch_s>Behind the main altar is the shrine and tomb of Edward the Confessor.<ch_s>Saints' shrines were once common in English medieval churches, but most were destroyed during the English Reformation and Edward is the only major English saint whose body still occupies his shrine.<ch_s>Arranged around him in a horseshoe shape are a series of tombs of medieval kings and their queens: Henry III, Eleanor of Castile, Edward I, Philippa of Hainault, Edward III, Anne of Bohemia, and Richard II.<ch_s>Henry V is in the centre of the horseshoe, at the eastern end.<ch_s>Henry III's tomb was originally covered with pieces of coloured glass and stone, since picked off by generations of tourists.<ch_s>Above Henry V's tomb, at mezzanine level over the ambulatory, is a chantry chapel built by mason John Thirske and decorated with many sculpted figures (including Henry V riding a horse and being crowned in the abbey).<ch_s>At the western end, the shrine is separated from the main church by a stone reredos which makes it a semi-private space.<ch_s>The reredos depicts episodes from Edward's life, including his birth and the building of the abbey.<ch_s>The shrine is closed to the public, except for special events.
<ch_s>The abbey includes side chapels radiating from the ambulatory.<ch_s>Many were originally included in the 13th-century rebuilding as altars dedicated to individual saints, and many of the chapels still bear saints' names (such as St Nicholas and St Paul).<ch_s>Saints' cults were no longer orthodox after the English Reformation, and the chapels were repurposed as places for extra burials and monuments.<ch_s>In the north ambulatory are the Islip Chapel, the Nurses' Memorial Chapel (sometimes called the Nightingale Chapel), the Chapel of Our Lady of the Pew, the Chapel of St John the Baptist, and St Paul's Chapel.<ch_s>The Islip Chapel is named after Abbot John Islip, who commissioned it in the 16th century.<ch_s>The screen inside is decorated with a visual pun on his name: an eye and a boy falling from a tree (eye-slip).<ch_s>Additional chapels in the eastern aisle of the north transept are named after (from south to north)<ch_s>St John the Evangelist, St Michael, and St Andrew.<ch_s>The chapels of St Nicholas, St Edmund, and St Benedict are in the south ambulatory.
<ch_s>The footprint of the south transept is smaller than the northern one because the 13th-century builders butted against the pre-existing 11th-century cloisters.<ch_s>To make the transepts match, the south transept overhangs the western cloister; this permitted a room above the cloisters which was used to store the abbey muniments.<ch_s>In the south transept is the chapel of St Faith, built c. 1250 as the vestry for the abbey's monks.<ch_s>On the east wall is a c. 1290 – c. 1310 painting of St Faith holding the grid-iron on which she was roasted to death.


<ch_s>=== Chapter house and Pyx Chamber ===
The octagonal chapter house was used by the abbey monks for daily meetings, where they would hear a chapter of the Rule of St Benedict and receive their instructions for the day from the abbot.<ch_s>The chapter house was built between 1250 and 1259 and is one of the largest in Britain, measuring nearly 60 feet (18 m) across.<ch_s>For 300 years after the English Reformation, it was used to store state records until they were moved to the Public Record Office in 1863.<ch_s>It was restored by George Gilbert Scott in the 19th century.
<ch_s>The entrance is approached from the east cloister via outer and inner vestibules, and the ceiling becomes higher as a visitor approaches the chapter house.<ch_s>It is an octagonal room with a central pillar, built with a small crypt below.<ch_s>Around the sides are benches for 80 monks, above which are large stained-glass windows depicting the coats of arms of several monarchs and the abbey's patrons and abbots.<ch_s>The exterior includes flying buttresses (added in the 14th century) and a leaded roof designed by Scott.<ch_s>The interior walls of the chapter house are decorated with 14th- and 15th-century paintings of the Apocalypse, the Last Judgement, and birds and animals.<ch_s>The chapter house also has an original, mid-13th-century tiled floor.<ch_s>A wooden door in the vestibule, made with a tree felled between 1032 and 1064, is one of Britain's oldest.<ch_s>It may have been the door to the 11th-century chapter house in Edward the Confessor's abbey, and was re-used as the door to the Pyx Chamber in the 13th century.<ch_s>It now leads to an office.
<ch_s>The adjoining Pyx Chamber was the undercroft of the monks' dormitory.<ch_s>Dating to the late 11th century, it was used as a monastic and royal treasury.<ch_s>The outer walls and circular piers also date to the 11th century; several capitals were enriched in the 12th century, and the stone altar was added in the 13th century.<ch_s>The term pyx refers to the boxwood chest in which coins were held and presented to a jury during the Trial of the Pyx, when newly minted coins were presented to ensure they conformed to the required standards.<ch_s>The chapter house and Pyx Chamber are in the guardianship of English Heritage, but under the care and management of the Dean and Chapter of Westminster.


<ch_s>=== Henry VII Chapel<ch_s>===

The Henry VII Lady Chapel, also known simply as the Henry VII Chapel, is a large lady chapel at the far eastern end of the abbey which was paid for by the will of King Henry VII.<ch_s>The chapel, built in late Perpendicular Gothic style, inspired English poet John Leland to call it the orbis miraculum (the wonder of the world).<ch_s>The tombs of several monarchs, including Edward V, Henry VII, Edward VI, Mary I, Elizabeth I, James I, Charles II, George II and Mary, Queen of Scots, are in the chapel.
<ch_s>It is noted for its pendant- and fan vault-style ceiling, probably designed by William Vertue, which writer Washington Irving said was "achieved with the wonderful minuteness and airy security of a cobweb".<ch_s>The ceiling is not a true fan vault, but a groin vault disguised as a fan vault.<ch_s>The interior walls are densely decorated with carvings, including 95 statues of saints.<ch_s>Many statues of saints in England were destroyed in the 17th century, so these are rare survivors.<ch_s>Like much of the rest of the medieval building, they would originally have been painted and gilded.<ch_s>From outside, The chapel walls are supported from outside by flying buttresses, each in the form of a polygonal tower topped with a cupola.<ch_s>At the centre of the chapel is the tomb of Henry VII and his wife, Elizabeth of York, which was sculpted by Pietro Torrigiano (who fled to England from Italy after breaking Michaelangelo's nose in a fight).
<ch_s>The chapel has sub-chapels radiating from the main structure.<ch_s>One, to the north, contains the tombs of Mary I and Elizabeth I; both coffins are in Elizabeth's monument.<ch_s>Another, to the south, contains the tomb of Mary, Queen of Scots.<ch_s>Both monuments were commissioned by James I, Elizabeth's successor to the English throne and Mary's son.<ch_s>At the far eastern end is the RAF Chapel, with a stained-glass window dedicated to those who died in the 1940 Battle of Britain.<ch_s>The RAF Chapel was the original burial site of Oliver Cromwell in 1658.<ch_s>Cromwell was disinterred in 1661, after the Stuart Restoration, when his body was hanged in chains on the gallows at Tyburn.
<ch_s>The chapel has been the mother church of the Order of the Bath since 1725, and the banners of its members hang above the stalls.<ch_s>The stalls retain their medieval misericords: small ledges for monks to perch on during services, often decorated with varied and humorous carvings.


<ch_s>=== Monastic buildings ===

Many rooms used by the monks have been repurposed.<ch_s>The dormitory became a library and a school room, and the monks' offices have been converted into houses for the clergy.<ch_s>The abbot had his own lodgings, and ate separately from the rest of the monks.<ch_s>The lodgings, now used by the Dean of Westminster, are probably the oldest continuously occupied residence in London.<ch_s>They include the Jericho Parlour (covered in wooden linenfold panelling), the Jerusalem Chamber (commissioned in 1369), and a grand dining hall with a minstrels' gallery which is now used by Westminster School.<ch_s>The prior also had his own household, separate from the monks, on the site of present-day Ashburnham House in Little Dean's Yard (now also part of Westminster School).


<ch_s>== Artworks and treasures ==
The nave and transepts have sixteen crystal chandeliers made of hand-blown Waterford glass.<ch_s>Designed by A. B. Read and Stephen Dykes Bower, they were donated by the Guinness family in 1965 to commemorate the abbey's 900th anniversary.<ch_s>The choir stalls were designed by Edward Blore in 1848.<ch_s>Some stalls are assigned to high commissioners of countries in the Commonwealth of Nations.
<ch_s>Beyond the crossing to the west is the sacrarium, which contains the high altar.<ch_s>The abbey has the 13th-century Westminster Retable, thought to be the altarpiece from Henry III's 13th-century church and the earliest surviving English panel painting altatrpiece, in its collections.<ch_s>The present high altar and screen were designed by George Gilbert Scott between 1867 and 1873, with sculptures of Moses, St Peter, St Paul, and King David by H. H. Armistead, as well as a mosaic of the Last Supper by J. R. Clayton and Antonio Salviati.
<ch_s>The south transept contains wall paintings made c. 1300, which Richard Jenkyns calls "the grandest of their time remaining in England".<ch_s>Depicting Thomas the Apostle looking at Christ's wounds and St Christopher carrying the Christ Child, the paintings were discovered in 1934 behind two monuments.<ch_s>Fourteenth-century paintings are on the backs of the sedilia (seats used by priests on either side of the high altar).<ch_s>On the south side are three figures: Edward the Confessor, the angel Gabriel, and the Virgin Mary.<ch_s>On the north side are two kings (possibly Henry III and Edward I) surrounding a religious figure, possibly St Peter.<ch_s>They were walled off during the Commonwealth period by order of Parliament, and were later rediscovered.
<ch_s>Over the Great West Door are ten statues of 20th-century Christian martyrs of various denominations; the statues were sculpted by the abbey's craftsmen in 1998.<ch_s>Those commemorated are Maximilian Kolbe, Manche Masemola, Janani Luwum, Grand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna, Martin Luther King Jr., Óscar Romero, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Esther John, Lucian Tapiedi, and Wang Zhiming.
<ch_s>From the chapter house is a doorway leading to the abbey's library, which was built as a dormitory for the monks and has been used as a library since the 16th century.<ch_s>The collection has about 16,000 volumes.<ch_s>Next to the library is the Muniment Room, where the abbey's historic archives are kept.


<ch_s>=== Cosmati pavement ===

At the crossing in front of Edward the Confessor's shrine and the main altar is the Cosmati pavement, a 700-year-old tile floor made of almost 30,000 pieces of coloured glass and stone.<ch_s>Measuring almost 25 feet square, coronations take place here.
<ch_s>The floor is named after the Cosmati family in Rome, who were known for such work.<ch_s>It was commissioned by Richard Ware, who travelled to Rome in 1258, when he became abbot, and returned with stone and artists.<ch_s>The porphyry used was originally quarried as far away as Egypt, and was presumably brought to Italy during the Roman Empire.<ch_s>It was surrounded by a Latin inscription in brass letters (since lost) identifying the artist as Odericus, probably referring to designer Pietro di Oderisio or his son.<ch_s>The inscription also predicted the end of the world 19,863 years after its creation.<ch_s>Unlike traditional mosaic work, the pieces were not cut to a uniform size but made using a technique known as opus sectile ("cut work").<ch_s>It is unique among Cosmati floors in Europe for the use of dark Purbeck-marble trays, forming bold borders, instead of the more typical white marble.<ch_s>The pavement influenced later floor treatments at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, and Canterbury Cathedral.
<ch_s>Geometric designs, such as those in the pavement, were thought to help the abbey's monks with contemplation, and conveyed medieval Christian ideas on the nature of the universe that could not easily be put into words.<ch_s>Much of the design relies on the geometric doubling of the square, considered a trade secret by stonemasons.<ch_s>The four-sided squares, four-fold symmetry, and the four inner roundels of the design represent the four elements of classical philosophy, with the central roundel representing the unformed state of the universe at its creation.<ch_s>Each inner roundel is touched by two bands, which represent the shared qualities of each element; water and air were both considered "moist" in classical philosophy, and air and fire were both considered "hot".


<ch_s>=== Stained glass ===

The abbey's 13th-century windows would have been filled with stained glass, but much of this was destroyed in the English Civil War and the Blitz and was replaced with clear, plain glass.<ch_s>Since the 19th century, new stained glass, designed by artists such as Ninian Comper (on the north side of the nave) and Hugh Easton and Alan Younger (in the Henry VII Chapel), has replaced clear glass.
<ch_s>The north rose window was designed by James Thornhill and made by Joshua Price in 1722; it shows Christ, the apostles (without Judas Iscariot), the Four Evangelists, and, in the centre, the Bible.<ch_s>The window was restored by J. L. Pearson in the 19th century, during which the feet of the figures were cut off.<ch_s>Thornhill also designed the great west window, which shows the Biblical figures of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as well as representatives of the Twelve Tribes of Israel underneath.
<ch_s>In the Henry VII Chapel, the west window was designed by John Lawson and unveiled in 1995.<ch_s>It depicts coats of arms and cyphers of Westminster Abbey's benefactors, particularly John Templeton (whose coat of arms is prominent in the lower panel).<ch_s>In the centre are the arms of Elizabeth II.<ch_s>The central east window, designed by Alan Younger and dedicated to the Virgin Mary, was unveiled in 2000.<ch_s>It depicts Comet Hale–Bopp, which was passing over the artist's house at the time, as the star of Bethlehem.<ch_s>The donors of the window, Lord and Lady Harris of Peckham, are shown kneeling at the bottom.
<ch_s>In 2018, artist David Hockney unveiled a new stained-glass window for the north transept to celebrate the reign of Elizabeth II.<ch_s>It shows a country scene inspired by his native Yorkshire, with hawthorn blossoms and blue skies.<ch_s>Hockney used an iPad to design the window, replicating the backlight that comes through stained glass.


<ch_s>=== Queen's Diamond Jubilee Galleries ===

The Westminster Abbey Museum was located in the 11th-century vaulted undercroft beneath the former monks' dormitory.<ch_s>This is one of the oldest areas of the abbey, dating almost to the foundation of the church by Edward the Confessor in 1065.<ch_s>This space had been used as a museum since 1908, but was closed to the public when it was replaced as a museum in June 2018 by the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Galleries (high in the abbey's triforium and accessed through the Weston Tower, which encloses a lift and stairs).
<ch_s>The exhibits include a set of life-size effigies of English and British monarchs and their consorts, originally made to lie on the coffin in the funeral procession or to be displayed over the tomb.<ch_s>The effigies date from the 14th to the 18th centuries, and some include original clothes.
<ch_s>On display in the galleries is The Coronation Theatre, Westminster Abbey: A Portrait of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, a portrait by Ralph Heimans of the queen standing on the Cosmati pavement where she was crowned in 1953.<ch_s>Other exhibits include a model of an unbuilt tower designed by Christopher Wren; a paper model of the abbey as it was for Queen Victoria's 1837 coronation; and the wedding licence of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, who were married in the abbey in 2011.


<ch_s>== Burials and memorials ==

Over 3,300 people are buried or commemorated in the abbey.<ch_s>For much of its history, most of the people buried there (other than monarchs) were people with a connection to the church – either ordinary locals or the monks of the abbey, who were generally buried without surviving markers.<ch_s>Since the 18th century, it has been an honour for any British person to be buried or commemorated in the abbey – a practice boosted by the lavish funeral and monument of Isaac Newton, who died in 1727.<ch_s>By 1900, so many prominent figures were buried in the abbey that the writer William Morris called it a "National Valhalla".
<ch_s>Politicians buried in the abbey include Pitt the Elder, Charles James Fox, Pitt the Younger, William Wilberforce, William Gladstone, and Clement Attlee.<ch_s>A cluster of scientists surrounds the tomb of Isaac Newton, including Charles Darwin and Stephen Hawking.<ch_s>Actors include David Garrick, Henry Irving, and Laurence Olivier.<ch_s>Musicians tend to be buried in the north aisle of the nave, and include Henry Purcell and Ralph Vaughan Williams.<ch_s>George Frideric Handel is buried in Poets' Corner.

<ch_s>An estimated 18 English, Scottish and British monarchs are buried in the abbey, including Edward the Confessor, Henry III, Edward I, Edward III, Richard II, Henry V, Edward V, Henry VII, Edward VI, Mary I, Mary Queen of Scots, Elizabeth I, James I, Charles II, Mary II, William III, Queen Anne, and George II.<ch_s>Elizabeth and Mary Queen of Scots were the last monarchs to be buried with full tomb effigies; monarchs buried after them are commemorated in the abbey with simple inscriptions.<ch_s>George II was the last monarch to be buried in the abbey, in 1760, and George III's brother, Henry Frederick, was the last member of the royal family to be buried in the abbey, in 1790.<ch_s>Most monarchs after George II have been buried in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, or at the Frogmore Royal Burial Ground, east of Windsor Castle.


<ch_s>=== Poets' Corner ===

The south transept of the church is known as Poets' Corner because of its high number of burials of, and memorials to, poets and writers.<ch_s>The first was Geoffrey Chaucer (buried around 1400), who was employed as Clerk of the King's Works and had apartments in the abbey.<ch_s>A second poet, Edmund Spenser (who was local to the abbey), was buried nearby in 1599.<ch_s>The idea of a Poets' Corner did not crystallise until the 18th century, when memorials were established to writers buried elsewhere, such as William Shakespeare and John Milton.<ch_s>Since then, writers buried in Poets' Corner have included John Dryden, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, Charles Dickens, and Rudyard Kipling.<ch_s>Not all writers buried in the abbey are in the south transept; Ben Jonson is buried standing upright in the north aisle of the nave, and Aphra Behn in the cloisters.


<ch_s>=== The Unknown Warrior ===

On the floor, just inside the Great West Door in the centre of the nave, is the grave of the Unknown Warrior: an unidentified soldier killed on a European battlefield during the First World War.<ch_s>Although many countries have a Tomb of the Unknown Soldier (or Warrior), the one in Westminster Abbey was the first; it came about as a response to the unprecedented death toll of the war.<ch_s>The idea came from army chaplain David Railton, who suggested it in 1920.<ch_s>The funeral was held on 11 November 1920, the second anniversary of the end of the war.<ch_s>The Unknown Warrior lay in state for a week afterwards, and an estimated 1.25 million people viewed his gravesite in that time.<ch_s>This grave is the only floor stone in the abbey on which it is forbidden to walk, and every visit by a foreign head of state begins with a visit to it.


<ch_s>== Royal occasions ==
The abbey has strong connections with the royal family.<ch_s>It has been patronised by monarchs, been the location for coronations, royal weddings and funerals, and several monarchs have attended services there.<ch_s>One monarch was born and one died at Westminster Abbey.<ch_s>In 1413, Henry IV collapsed while praying at the shrine of Edward the Confessor.<ch_s>He was moved into the Jerusalem Chamber, and died shortly afterwards.<ch_s>Edward V was born in the abbot's house in 1470.

<ch_s>The first jubilee celebration held at the abbey was for Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee in 1887.<ch_s>Rather than wearing the full regalia that she had worn at her coronation, she wore her black mourning clothes topped with the insignia of the Order of the Garter and a miniature crown.<ch_s>She sat in the Coronation Chair—which received a coat of dark varnish for the occasion, which was painstakingly removed afterwards—making her the only monarch to sit in the chair twice.<ch_s>Queen Elizabeth II and her husband, Prince Philip, marked their silver, gold, and diamond wedding anniversaries with services at the abbey and regularly attended annual observances there for Commonwealth Day.
<ch_s>The monarch participates in the Office of the Royal Maundy on Maundy Thursday each year, during which selected elderly people (as many people of each sex as the monarch has years of their life) receive alms of coins.<ch_s>The service has been held at churches around the country since 1952, returning to the abbey every 10 years.


<ch_s>=== Coronations ===

Since the coronation of William the Conqueror in 1066, 40 English and British monarchs have been crowned in Westminster Abbey (not counting Edward V, Lady Jane Grey, and Edward VIII, who were never crowned).<ch_s>In 1216, Henry III could not be crowned in the abbey because London was occupied by hostile forces at the time.<ch_s>Henry was crowned in Gloucester Cathedral, and had a second coronation at Westminster Abbey in 1220.<ch_s>When he had the abbey rebuilt, it was designed with long transepts to accommodate many guests at future coronations.<ch_s>Much of the order of service derives from the Liber Regalis, an illuminated manuscript made in 1377 for the coronation of Richard II and held in the abbey's collections.<ch_s>On 6 May 2023, the coronation of Charles III took place at the abbey.<ch_s>The area used in the church is the crossing, known in the abbey as "the theatre" because of its suitability for grand events.<ch_s>The space in the crossing is clear rather than filled with immovable pews (like many similar churches), allowing for temporary seating in the transepts.

<ch_s>The Coronation Chair (the throne on which English and British sovereigns are seated when they are crowned) is in the abbey's St George's Chapel near the west door, and has been used at coronations since the 14th century.<ch_s>From 1301 to 1996 (except for a short time in 1950, when the stone was stolen by Scottish nationalists), the chair housed the Stone of Scone upon which the kings of Scots were crowned.<ch_s>Although it has been kept in Scotland at Edinburgh Castle since 1996, the stone is returned to the Coronation Chair in the abbey as needed for coronations.<ch_s>The chair was accessible to the public during the 18th and 19th centuries; people could sit in it, and some carved initials into the woodwork.
<ch_s>Before the 17th century, a king would hold a separate coronation for his new queen if he married after his coronation.<ch_s>The last of these to take place in the abbey was the coronation of Anne Boleyn in 1533, after her marriage to Henry VIII.<ch_s>Fifteen coronations of queens consort have been held in the abbey.<ch_s>A coronation for Jane Seymour, Henry VIII's third wife, was planned but she died before it took place; no coronations were planned for Henry's subsequent wives.<ch_s>Mary I's husband, Philip of Spain, was not given a separate coronation due to concerns that he would attempt to rule alone after Mary's death.<ch_s>Since then, there have been few opportunities for a second coronation; monarchs have generally come to the throne already married.
<ch_s>Henry II held a coronation ceremony at Westminster Abbey in 1170 for his son, known as Henry the Young King, while Henry II was still alive in an attempt to secure the succession.<ch_s>However, the Young King died before his father and never took the throne.


<ch_s>=== Weddings ===
At least 16 royal weddings have taken place at the abbey.<ch_s>Royal weddings at the abbey were relatively rare before the 20th century, with royals often married in a Chapel Royal or at Windsor Castle; this changed with the 1922 wedding of Princess Mary at the abbey.<ch_s>In 1923, Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon became the first royal bride to leave her bouquet on the grave of the Unknown Warrior, a practice continued by many royal brides since.

<ch_s>Royal weddings have included:


<ch_s>=== Funerals ===
Many royal funerals took place at the abbey between that of Edward the Confessor in 1066 and that of Prince Henry, the last royal buried in the church, in 1790.<ch_s>There were no royal funerals at the abbey from then until that of Queen Alexandra in 1925; the queen was buried in Windsor Castle.<ch_s>Other queen consorts, such as Mary of Teck in 1953 and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in 2002, have also had funerals at the abbey before being buried elsewhere.
<ch_s>On 6 September 1997, the ceremonial funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales was held at the abbey.<ch_s>Before the funeral, the railings of the abbey were swamped with flowers and tributes.<ch_s>The event was more widely seen than any previous occasion in the abbey's history, with 2 billion television viewers worldwide.<ch_s>Diana was buried privately on a private island at Althorp, her family estate.
<ch_s>On 19 September 2022, the state funeral of Elizabeth II took place at the abbey before her burial at St George's Chapel, Windsor.<ch_s>It was the first funeral of a monarch at Westminster Abbey for more than 260 years.


<ch_s>== People ==


=== Dean and Chapter ===

Westminster Abbey is a collegiate church governed by the Dean and Chapter of Westminster as established by a royal charter from Elizabeth I dated 21 May 1560, which created it as the Collegiate Church of St Peter Westminster (a royal peculiar).<ch_s>In 2019, David Hoyle was appointed Dean of Westminster.<ch_s>The chapter consists of four canons and a senior administrative officer, known as the Receiver General.<ch_s>One of the canons is also rector of the adjoining St Margaret's Church, Westminster, and is often the chaplain of the Speaker of the House of Commons.<ch_s>In addition to the dean and canons, there are minor canons.


<ch_s>=== King's almsmen ===
Six King's (or Queen's) almsmen and women are supported by the abbey.<ch_s>They are appointed by royal warrant on the recommendation of the dean and the Home Secretary, attend Matins and Evensong on Sundays, and perform requested duties for a small stipend.<ch_s>On duty, they wear a distinctive red gown with a crowned rose badge on the left shoulder.
<ch_s>The almshouse was founded near the abbey by Henry VII in 1502, and the twelve almsmen and three almswomen were originally minor court officials who were retired due to age or disability.<ch_s>They were required to be over the age of 50, single, with a good reputation, literate, able to look after themselves, and with an income of under £4 per year.<ch_s>The building survived the Dissolution of the Monasteries, but was demolished for road-widening in 1779.<ch_s>From the late 18th to the late 20th century, almsmen were usually old soldiers and sailors; today, they are primarily retired abbey employees.


<ch_s>=== Schools ===

Westminster School is in the abbey.<ch_s>Instruction has taken place since the 14th century with the monks of the abbey; the school regards its founder as Elizabeth I, who dissolved the monastery for the last time and provided for the establishment of the school, the dean, canons, assistant clergy, and lay officers.<ch_s>The schoolboys were rambunctious; Westminster boys have defaced the Coronation Chair, disrupted services, and once interrupted the consecration of four bishops with a bare-knuckle fight in the cloisters.<ch_s>One schoolboy carved on the Coronation Chair that he had slept in it overnight, making him probably its longest inhabitant.<ch_s>Westminster School became independent of the abbey Dean and Chapter in 1868, although the institutions remain closely connected.<ch_s>Westminster Abbey Choir School, also on the abbey grounds, educates the choirboys who sing for abbey services.


<ch_s>=== Order of the Bath ===

The Most Honourable Order of the Bath is a British order of chivalry whose spiritual home is the abbey's Henry VII Chapel.<ch_s>The order was founded by George I in 1725, fell out of fashion after 1812, and was revived by George V in 1913.<ch_s>The name derives from the elaborate medieval ceremony for appointing a knight, which included bathing as a symbol of purification.<ch_s>Members are given stalls with their banner, crest, and a stall plate at installation ceremonies in the abbey every four years.<ch_s>Since there are more members than stalls, some members wait many years for their installation.<ch_s>The Order of the Bath is the fourth-oldest British orders of chivalry, after the Orders of the Garter, the Thistle, and St Patrick (the latter is presently dormant).


<ch_s>== Music ==

Andrew Nethsingha has been the abbey's organist and master of the choristers since 2023.<ch_s>Peter Holder is the sub-organist, Matthew Jorysz the assistant organist, and Dewi Rees is the organ scholar.


<ch_s>=== Choir ===
Since its foundation in the 14th century, the primary role of the Westminster Abbey choir has been to sing for daily services; the choir also plays a central role in many state occasions, including royal weddings and funerals, coronations, and memorial services.<ch_s>In 2012, the choir accepted an invitation from Pope Benedict XVI to sing with the Sistine Chapel Choir at a Papal Mass in St Peter's Basilica.<ch_s>The all-male choir consists of twelve professional adult singers and thirty boy choristers from eight to 13 years old who attend the Westminster Abbey Choir School.


<ch_s>=== Organ ===
The first record of an organ at Westminster Abbey was the mention of a gift of three marks from Henry III in 1240 for the repair of one (or more) organs.<ch_s>Unum parem organorum ("a pair of organs") was recorded in the Lady Chapel in 1304.<ch_s>An inventory compiled for the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1540 lists a pair of organs in the choir and one in the Islip Chapel.<ch_s>During the Commonwealth, a Royalist source said that soldiers who were billeted in the abbey "brake downe the Organ, and pawned the pipes at severall Ale-houses for pots of Ale"; an organ was played at the Restoration in 1660, however, suggesting that it had not been completely destroyed.<ch_s>In 1720, an organ gifted by George II and built by Christopher Shrider was installed over the choir screen; organs had previously been hidden on the north side of the choir.<ch_s>The organ was rebuilt by William Hill & Son in 1848.
<ch_s>A new organ was built by Harrison & Harrison in 1937, with four manuals and 84 speaking stops, and was played publicly for the first time at the coronation of George VI and Elizabeth that year.<ch_s>Some pipework from the previous Hill organ of 1848 was re-voiced and incorporated into the new instrument.<ch_s>The two organ cases, designed and built in the late 19th century by J. L. Pearson, were reinstated and coloured in 1959.
<ch_s>In 1982 and 1987, Harrison & Harrison enlarged the organ at the direction of Simon Preston to include an additional lower choir organ and a bombarde organ.<ch_s>The full instrument has five manuals and 109 speaking stops.<ch_s>Its console was refurbished by Harrison & Harrison in 2006, and space was prepared for two additional 16-foot stops on the lower choir organ and the bombarde organ.<ch_s>The abbey has three other organs: the two-manual Queen's Organ in the Lady Chapel, a smaller continuo organ, and a practice organ.


<ch_s>=== Bells ===
There have been bells at the abbey since at least the time of Henry III, and the current bells were installed in the north-west tower in 1971.<ch_s>The ring is made up of ten bells, hung for change ringing, which were cast in 1971 by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry and tuned to the musical notes F#, E, D, C#, B, A, G, F#, E and D.<ch_s>The tenor bell in D (588.5 Hz) has a weight of 30 cwt, 1 qtr, 15 lb (3,403 lb, or 1,544 kg).<ch_s>Two additional service bells were cast by Robert Mot in 1585 and 1598, and a sanctus bell was cast in 1738 by Richard Phelps and Thomas Lester.<ch_s>Two bells are unused; one was cast c. 1320, and the second was cast in 1742 by Thomas Lester.<ch_s>The Westminster Abbey Company of Ringers ring peals on special occasions, such as the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton.


<ch_s>== In popular culture ==

Westminster Abbey is mentioned in the play Henry VIII by William Shakespeare and John Fletcher, when a gentleman describes Anne Boleyn's coronation.<ch_s>The abbey was mentioned in a 1598 sonnet by Thomas Bastard which begins, "When I behold, with deep astonishment /<ch_s>To famous Westminster how there restort / Living in brass or stony monument /<ch_s>The princes and the worthies of all sort".<ch_s>Poetry about the abbey has also been written by Francis Beaumont and John Betjeman.<ch_s>The building has appeared in paintings by artists such as Canaletto, Wenceslaus Hollar, William Bruce Ellis Ranken, and J. M. W. Turner.
<ch_s>Playwright Alan Bennett produced The Abbey, a 1995 documentary recounting his experiences of the building.<ch_s>Key scenes in the book and film The Da Vinci Code take place in Westminster Abbey.<ch_s>The abbey refused to allow filming in 2005 (calling the book "theologically unsound"), and the film uses Lincoln Cathedral as a stand-in.<ch_s>The abbey issued a fact sheet to their staff which answered questions and debunked several claims made in the book.<ch_s>In 2022, it was announced that the abbey had given rare permission to film inside the church for Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning.
